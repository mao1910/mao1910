 #### - [Don't sound like a robot: use CSS to Control Text-to-Speech](https://dev.to/ingosteinke/using-css-to-control-text-to-speech-1i0d) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Websites often sound like a vintage science-fiction robot when using a screen reader / text-to-speech output to read the text aloud.</p>

<p>While there might be a good reason to do so, as this tone of voice was easier to understand when playing it at double or triple speed, that's also true for other ways of speaking.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OS4N2QS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jlczzrmi3avkezj6gw0d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0OS4N2QS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jlczzrmi3avkezj6gw0d.png" alt="Drawing of a cartoon robot saying: I am not a robot. Human character relies: but you sound like a robot." width="800" height="600"></a></p>

<p>"I am not a ro-bot" - "but you sound like a robot!"</p>

<p>Scholars, actors or opera singers use an exaggerated articulation to facilitate understanding. Another example is classic radio advertisement where they often speak in a fast, high-pitched and overly excited voice to convey both emotion a lot of information in a few seconds of time.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How does your website sound?
</h2>

<p>In his <a href="https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/dusseldorf-2022/speakers/vasilis-van-gemert">beyond Tellerrand 2022 talk "exclusive design", Vasilis van Gemert proved</a> that you can add an individual touch to your website using some sort of simple poetry or exclamation expressions in ALT attributes like "boing boing".</p>

<p><iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkKkAgjsfgQ">

</p>

<p>Some screen readers offer different voices, often at least one female and one male one, but that's a client setting that doesn't change for a website an its content.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  CSS Voice Control
</h2>

<p>Now we can use CSS to declare different voices much like we use CSS to declare font families and typographic details. So we could make a Q&amp;A section sound like someone is asking and another voice is answering the questions.</p>

<p>Code syntax is still an early draft, so it might change before browser support, but the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/">current recommendation (CSS Speech Module Level 1)</a> looks quite similar to typography:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">selector</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">female</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-pitch</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">medium</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>As the property is still experimental, <a href="https://stylelint.io">stylelint</a> does not recognize it yet at the time of writing this, so let's explicitly disable the <code>property-no-unknown</code> rule only where we use it by adding a <code>stylelint-disable</code> comment and re-enable it afterwards.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">selector</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">/* stylelint-disable property-no-unknown */</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">female</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-pitch</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">medium</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-stress</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">moderate</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-rate</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">fast</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-volume</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">soft</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">pause-after</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">strong</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">voice-balance</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">left</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="c">/* stylelint-enable property-no-unknown */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Pretty much the same like we have to do with some other helpful styles that became common practice but are not standard yet, like optimizing text rendering legibility rather than optimizing rendering speed.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">selector</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">/* stylelint-disable-next-line value-keyword-case */</span>
  <span class="nl">text-rendering</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">optimizeLegibility</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Altogether, some of our base styles might look like this.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">html</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">body</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">main</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--color-primary-background</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--color-primary-foreground</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nl">font-family</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--font-family-default</span><span class="p">);</span>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Reflecting on my decade-long journey with C#, I find myself back at the beginning. A time when each line of code was an experiment, each bug a stumbling block on the path to progress. Solutions danced just out of reach, teasingly close yet confoundingly elusive. But every hurdle surmounted, every victorious moment when code ran flawlessly, brought with it a sense of accomplishment that made every setback worthwhile.</p>

<p>In hindsight, the wisdom cultivated through evenings hovered over my keyboard becomes glaringly apparent. I find myself craving a path back to the past, an opportunity to guide my younger self. To unravel the intricacies of logic in C#, to master the art of debugging, to explain the principles of object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>How I wish I could illuminate this path of discovery, soothing the sting of trial by fire. Fast forward through hours of relentless debugging and lead my past self swiftly towards the realm of C# proficiency.</p>

<p>If you are setting out on your journey with C#, or find yourself in the labyrinth of code somewhere along the way, the lessons I‚Äôve learned may serve as your guiding light. I offer you these 13 pearls, insights skimmed from a decadal voyage across the ocean of C#. Embrace these lessons as a compass, pointing you towards a code-laden horizon.</p>

<p>Embark on this journey as we delve into ‚ÄúMy C# Time Machine: 13 Lessons From a 10-Year Voyage,‚Äù offering you a collection of lessons I wish I‚Äôd had at the start of my C# exploration.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Part I: OOP, Handle Errors, Tooling
</h2>

<p>In the initial days of my exploration with code, the words I would whisper to my past self in those still, early mornings would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúOOP- Encounter It, Understand It, Use It!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why, you might ask?</p>

<p>Impressively complex and incredibly error-prone coding constructs were the result of my early inability to grasp Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) fully. I remember building a class, ‚ÄúEtchASketch,‚Äù with a bunch of commands and functions. But fundamental concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation were like closed books to my past self.</p>

<p>Once I built a good understanding of these pillars of OOP, my code became efficient, the complex class transformed into smaller, logical parts interacting with each other seamlessly.</p>

<p>In the world of coding, you must prepare for unexpected situations; harsh yet crucial learnings came from my experiences with error handling. I remember clearly, during a crucial demonstration, our application crashed due to an unhandled <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/5-good-practices-for-error-handling-in-c">exception</a> caused by a NULL reference.</p>

<p>This was a painful lesson about always expecting the unexpected with code, as the snippet below demonstrates, where I try to divide by zero. Using appropriate error handling methods such as the <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/try-catch-csharp">try-catch</a> block could have avoided those early mishaps:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">try</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
   <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="p">/</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">catch</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DivideByZeroException</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"An error occurred: "</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Message</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>On a third note, it‚Äôs essential to use the right tools. So many of my early challenges could have been tamed more easily with the correct toolset at hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúExplore Visual Studio. Discover the power of JetBrains Rider. These are your main gears in this technical journey!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debugging features, hot reload, file organization ‚Äì these integrated development environments had everything I needed. Ignoring them early in my career cost me time and effort, a mistake rectified as I became more comfortable with the tools of the trade.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Part II: LINQ, ASP.NET Core, Delegates
</h2>

<p>Drifting into our fourth chapter, we find ourselves inside the elegant dance of the Language Integrated Query ‚Äì or as we coders know it, <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/linq-csharp">LINQ</a>. Describing it wouldn‚Äôt be enough, allow me to share a simple code snippet to illustrate its simplicity and power.</p>

<p>Before LINQ, you would write a <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/foreach-loop-csharp">foreach</a> loop to find all odd numbers in a <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/list-csharp">list</a>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">oddNumbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>

<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span> <span class="p">%</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">!=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">oddNumbers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In the world of LINQ, this operation gets simpler:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="n">List</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">&gt;</span> <span class="n">oddNumbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">%</span><span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">!=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">ToList</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>LINQ translates raw SQL-like queries into the native language of C#. It simplifies complex operations and brings forth a more readable and maintainable code experience.</p>

<p>Venturing into the fifth revelation, we encounter the mighty ASP.NET Core. An important tool in any C# developer‚Äôs arsenal, especially when interacting with web development, let‚Äôs take a look at the ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Program</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">Main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>ASP.NET Core simplifies web application setup, effortlessly handling the server and routing for us. It shifts our focus from the repetitive boilerplate configurations to solving real problems that address user needs.</p>

<p>Our narrative concludes with the sixth revelation ‚Äì the power of Delegates and Events. Invoking a delegate allows you to create a customizable method that can be passed as a parameter. Here‚Äôs a basic demonstration:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="c1">// A delegate type for encapsulating a method that takes an int and returns void:</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">delegate</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">IntMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="n">IntMethod</span> <span class="n">myDelegate</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">MyClass</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IntMethod</span> <span class="n">passedDelegate</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">myDelegate</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">passedDelegate</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">InvokeDelegate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">myDelegate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this minimal example, the delegate <code>IntMethod</code> is defined to encapsulate a method that takes an integer parameter and returns <code>void</code>. Using delegates and events adds a new level of dynamism to your C# program and significantly improves the structure of your code.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Part III: NuGet, Code Readability, NUnit
</h2>

<p>Seventh on my list: the Package Savior, NuGet. I wrangled with dependencies, wrestled with DLLs vying for dominance, battling for the peace of compile-time. Then NuGet appeared, the unsung hero, the gentle giant of package management. It came bearing gifts, offering easier dependency management across projects, making what was once a difficult trek a mere stroll in the park.<br>

<p>Lesson eight, a simple one, yet it had a profound impact on my codesmithing: the art of crafting readable code. Sometimes, the most complex solution isn‚Äôt the best; sometimes it‚Äôs the most simple one. Deciphering old, cryptic code is like reaching back through time and questioning your past judgements. You‚Äôll thank yourself for the present of readable, maintainable code.<br>

<p>The ninth revelation hails from the realm of <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/unit-testing-csharp">unit testing</a> ‚Äì NUnit. Boldly I wrote code, untested and raw, only to watch it spectacularly implode. The idea of ‚Äúwrite, test, fix, repeat‚Äù quickly transformed from a playful game to an essential ritual. NUnit became the gatekeeper, ensuring each line of code performed its destined task without disturbing the peaceful harmony of the overall system.<br>

<p>Stepping into double digits, the tenth item on my list is ConfigureAwait. I should have paid more attention to Async/Await. I was young, ambitious and‚Äì as it turns out‚Äì terribly naive.

<p>Eleventh in line shines a light outside of the C#. The more languages you know, the better you become in each. A programmer spreading the net wider learns about different voices, approaches, and patterns. It‚Äôs like stepping out of your neighbourhood‚Äì everything you discover, you bring back home and apply to your own work.</p>

<p>Twelfth, the principle of simplicity as a beacon of brilliance. Learn to dispose of unwanted code, the rambles that clutter your digital realm. Don‚Äôt add new floors on a shaky old foundation‚Äì start afresh with sturdier materials.</p>

<p>Thirteenth, isn‚Äôt a lesson but an insight. Coding is a lifelong journey, not a destination. Each bug approached with a fresh perspective, each day an opportunity to acquire, apply and diversify knowledge. Coding isn‚Äôt an art; it‚Äôs a living, breathing way of life.</p>

<p>They say you truly become a coder when you spend more time reading and deciphering code than writing it. Yes, code-readability is paramount.</p>

<p>As I find myself nearing the end of this introspective journey, a decade-long liaison with C#, I realise coding isn‚Äôt just sequences of logical operations. It flowers from a seed of an idea, mutating through iterations, graced by failures and triumphs. It‚Äôs a constant learning, a dynamic evolution that transforms not just the creator, but the creation too. And so, we code, in pursuit of that zenith of perfection, armed with the knowledge that the journey is the destination. So, keep coding, keep learning, and most importantly, keep growing.</p>

 #### - [Examining Blockchain Transaction Speed: Real Performance vs. Marketing Claims](https://dev.to/fromaline/examining-blockchain-transaction-speed-real-performance-vs-marketing-claims-417g) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>In the ever-changing world of blockchain technology, there's often a lot of talk about how many transactions it can handle per second. But let's take a closer look beyond the marketing hype and dive into the actual world of blockchain speed, without all the complicated terms and fancy talk.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Understanding Blockchain Speed
</h2>

<p>In the world of blockchain, you often see big flashy numbers like "maximum transactions per second" advertised on websites and in marketing materials. But as people who use blockchain tech, we can tell fact from fiction. Today we will explore the real-time transaction speed versus those big "maximum transactions per second" claims that might change how you see things.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Setting the Stage: Real-Time vs. Maximum Theoretical Throughput
</h2>

<p>We expect there to be a difference between how many transactions a blockchain can handle in real-time and what's often advertised as the maximum throughput. Our goal is to dig deep and provide a detailed understanding that goes beyond surface-level numbers.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Our Approach: Revealing Actual Network Activity
</h2>

<p>Our method involves connecting to blockchain networks, fetching transactions, and calculating the average TPS based on data from the last 100 blocks. Every blockchain has its own pace with varying block times, but we're not going to take block time into consideration today for simplicity purposes.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Examining Well-Known Blockchain Projects
</h2>

<p>Let's take a good look at some well-known blockchain networks ‚Äì Solana, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, and Bitcoin ‚Äì and see how they really perform.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cb7LZchR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66o2zpzwsocwr0dja1ue.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Cb7LZchR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66o2zpzwsocwr0dja1ue.png" alt="Solana" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Solana might have said they can do "65,000 transactions per second" on their website, but in reality, they're clocking in at a pretty impressive 299.91! That's a huge 217 times more than what they claimed.</p>



<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E3e_KxyV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf27z4b0gy7h1wjcdyn9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E3e_KxyV--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mf27z4b0gy7h1wjcdyn9.png" alt="Arbitrum" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Arbitrum advertised a solid "40,000 transactions per second," but our investigation shows that they're really doing just 8.07 transactions per second. That's a massive difference of 4956 times ‚Äì a real wake-up call for accurate reporting.</p>



<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LPXimZ0h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qld9uuxxfwgkcsn7v8p2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LPXimZ0h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qld9uuxxfwgkcsn7v8p2.png" alt="Avalanche" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Avalanche claimed "4,500 transactions per second," but the actual speed is much lower at 2.01 transactions per second. This significant difference of 2500 times shows the importance of being transparent about real-world performance.</p>



<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q5LFdZgd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wi5wplx6vwcibxti2dar.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--q5LFdZgd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wi5wplx6vwcibxti2dar.png" alt="Ethereum" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Ethereum hasn't been making big claims about speed. Their maximum recorded speed is 56, and their current speed is around 11.14 transactions per second. While it's just five times less, it shows they're not overhyping their capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XEKP3fri--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mc4qdvoky4h9pwv2rgum.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XEKP3fri--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mc4qdvoky4h9pwv2rgum.png" alt="Bitcoin" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Bitcoin has never tried to be the fastest. Theoretically, it can handle about 7 transactions per second, but in practice, it's around 4.18. It's just 1.67 times less, but Bitcoin is all about trustworthiness and resilience.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Closing Thoughts: More Than Just Numbers
</h2>

<p>These findings highlight the big difference between what blockchain projects say they can do and what they actually do in the real world. While big numbers can be impressive, they're not the only measure of success. What really matters is how these technologies are adopted and used.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Data Source and Verification
</h2>

<p>We got our data from <a href="https://chainspect.app/">chainspect.app</a> üöÄ, but we encourage you to double-check our analysis. Blockchain's strength lies in its transparency and being able to verify things for yourself. Explore, scrutinize, and let the truth speak for itself.</p>

 #### - [My Frustrations With the Context API in React](https://dev.to/mohammadfaisal/my-frustrations-with-the-context-api-in-react-379m) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>To read more articles like this, <a href="https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev/blog">visit my blog</a></p>

<p>State management in React has come a long way. <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> is the longtime industry standard, but after the introduction of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">Context API</a>, many argue that the days of Redux are over.</p>

<p>I have had the privilege to work with both and use them in large projects.</p>

<p>I can understand the advantages that the Context API brings to the table, but I am going with Redux for my next project.</p>

<p>In a way, this is a love letter to Redux. Let‚Äôs begin!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Middleware Support
</h2>

<p>Middleware is an integral part of my workflow. I use them to show alerts based on the response of remote API calls without ever getting the result back to the component. Some other use cases can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Logging</p></li>
<li><p>Crash Reporting</p></li>
<li><p>Talking to an asynchronous API</p></li>
<li><p>Routing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how to do it with Redux:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">middleware</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">getDefaultMiddleware</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nx">errorMiddleware</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">loggerMiddleware</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">];</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">rootStore</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">configureStore</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="na">reducer</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">rootReducer</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">middleware</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>These are features that can hardly be ignored in most large-scale projects.</p>

<p>Implementing them with the Context API is possible, but Redux has made it much more manageable. Unfortunately, I find it unnecessarily complex to implement this with Context.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Provider Hell
</h2>

<p>Whether you‚Äôre using the Context API or Redux, it‚Äôs advised to keep the size of each reducer/context small for better understanding.</p>

<p>That's not an issue with Redux, as we can use <code>combineReducer()</code> to combine multiple reducers into a single store and wrap our whole application with that.</p>

<p>But in the Context API, you must wrap your component with the contexts that it actually needs. It creates a <em>provider hell</em> when your application grows large in size.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="k">export</span> <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">UserComponent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Context1</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Context2</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">value2</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Context3</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">value3</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
          <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Context4</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">value4</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

            <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">YOUR_COMPONENT_CODE</span><span class="p">}</span>

          <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Context4</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Context3</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Context2</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/Context1</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Yes, I am aware that there are some neat techniques to avoid this issue, like creating an HOC with the required context and wrapping the component with that HOC.</p>

<p>But imagine how many different considerations you have to keep in mind while coding. The situation gets worse when someone else comes and tries to dig through your code.</p>

<p>So why should we make our lives harder?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Familiar Data Flow
</h2>

<p>Redux has been used by so many projects that there is a high chance that most junior developers have encountered it at some point in their careers.</p>

<p>A typical Redux data flow looks like this: Component -&gt; Actions -&gt; (Middlewares) -&gt; Reducers -&gt; Component.</p>

<p>The workflow and structure of the code are predictable. I think it‚Äôs a huge advantage when working on a large project where developers are constantly coming and going.</p>

<p>When using Context, you don‚Äôt know where your contexts are. Each developer has their own way of organizing things. This can lead to some unnecessary overhead for others, which is costly.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Performance
</h2>

<p>You saw this coming. Context has known issues with performance because whenever any part of the context is updated, the whole sub-tree re-renders.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs say we wrap two components with a context. This context holds two values: <code>userDetails</code> and <code>orderList</code>.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="k">export</span> <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">App</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="nx">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">userDetails</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>

<p>The <code>UserComponent</code> depends on the value of <code>userDetails</code>, whereas <code>OrderComponent</code> depends on <code>orderList</code>.</p>

<p>Now if <code>userDetails</code> updates, both components re-render (although it has nothing to do with <code>OrderComponent</code>).</p>

<p>Do you see how an extensive application can misuse Context and create huge performance issues?</p>

<p>Yes, there are solutions like splitting the context or memorizing the component before updating. But with the help of <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSelector">selectors</a>, we can avoid this problem altogether. Why reinvent the wheel?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Clear Separation
</h2>

<p>Redux creates a clear separation of concerns. You can remove almost 100% of your data manipulation from your component.</p>

<p>Most modern applications depend on some kind of remote data anyway. So by using selectors, you can pre-process data before entering into the component.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_NV_MT5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2656/1%2AeFg5VVaOjqCKx0EP4VWhUw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p_NV_MT5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2656/1%2AeFg5VVaOjqCKx0EP4VWhUw.png" alt="Source: [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/https-medium-com-heypb-react-redux-workflow-in-4-steps-beginner-friendly-guide-4aea9d56f5bd)" width="800" height="642"></a></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a huge win when developing a large application before everybody knows where data comes from and how it‚Äôs being modified.</p>

<p>With Context, you don‚Äôt have the privilege to do that ‚Äî or at least it‚Äôs tricky to achieve.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Debugging
</h2>

<p>Regarding debugging, Redux provides an excellent toolkit that makes the debugging experience a breeze.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore">redux-toolkit</a>, it has become easier. You turn it on, and the rest is handled by Redux.</p>

<p>With Context, it‚Äôs much more challenging to visualize the changes happening. However, you can mitigate the problem by keeping your context small and predictable.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Plugin Support
</h2>

<p>Redux has rich plugin support that can facilitate many side functionalities that are time-consuming to implement and hard to maintain.</p>

<p>You can think of almost anything and be pleasantly surprised that someone else has already implemented the solution. Some of the most popular ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>redux-persist</p></li>
<li><p>redux-thunk</p></li>
<li><p>redux-form</p></li>
<li><p>reselect</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These plugins can improve the quality of your application. You have to learn some extra things, but they can reduce the hassle in the long run.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Size
</h2>

<p>In terms of size, you can argue that Redux needs additional resources to function, increasing the bundle size.</p>

<p>I agree with that, but is it that important when you have the benefits of a rich developer experience and a respectable community?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Final Thoughts
</h2>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong: If you can use Context correctly, most of these problems are solvable. Some might argue that it‚Äôs a safer option because it‚Äôs built-in.</p>

<p>I agree, but libraries and packages are there for a reason. For smaller projects, the Context API is OK. But for larger ones, I think going with Redux is the safer route.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think in the comments. Have a great day!</p>
