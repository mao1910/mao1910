 #### - [4 Open-Source Technologies Every True Full-Stack Developer Should Master](https://dev.to/rigdev/4-open-source-technologies-every-true-full-stack-developer-should-master-33e9) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Full-stack development is a constantly evolving, dynamic field with new tools and technologies. Developers often find themselves in pursuit of the best resources to streamline their workflow and build exceptional applications. From the frontend user interface to the backend server logic and all the data management in between, the task can seem daunting, and using the right set of tools makes all the difference. There are multiple frameworks and tools with different capabilities for every part of full-stack applications, and choosing the proper set helps simplify and streamline the development process.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll explore a powerful set of open-source frameworks and tools that can be a go-to option for a number of applications when building fully functional, full-stack projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwEzGfdG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p5gi8esxt2w8te6nq53.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GwEzGfdG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p5gi8esxt2w8te6nq53.gif" alt="Darth Full Stack" width="400" height="171"></a></p>

<p>The 4 technologies that we will discuss in this article are:</p>

<ol>
<li>React.js for Frontend Development</li>
<li>Golang for Backend Development</li>
<li>PostgreSQL for the Database layer</li>
<li>Rig.dev for DevOps/Deployment</li>
</ol>

<p>DevOps/Deployment has been added to expand the role of a full-stack developer within the entire development lifecycle.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Frontend with Reactjs
</h2>

<p>React.js, developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook), is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture sets it apart, which allows developers to break down user interfaces into reusable and encapsulated components. This approach fosters modular development and efficient rendering.</p>

<p>One of the great things about Reactjs is its popularity and community support. One will find a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries to enhance your React projects, and it's also one of the most versatile front-end frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>Use Cases and Examples</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Single-Page Applications (SPAs): React's component-based architecture is perfect for building SPAs, where dynamic content updates are essential.</li>
<li>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): React can create PWAs that provide a native app-like experience in the browser.</li>
<li>Interactive User Interfaces: React simplifies the development of complex UIs with interactive elements, such as forms, dashboards, and real-time data displays.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of React.js:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Component-Based Architecture: React's component-based approach encourages code reusability and maintainability by breaking user interfaces into reusable building blocks.</li>
<li>Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM minimizes browser updates, resulting in faster performance and a smoother user experience.</li>
<li>One-Way Data Flow: React's unidirectional data flow simplifies data management and enhances application predictability and testability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Backend with Golang
</h2>

<p>Go, often referred to as Golang is an open-source, statically typed programming language created by Google. While not a traditional backend framework, Go is known for its efficiency, simplicity, and robust standard library, making it an excellent choice for building server-side applications.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Functionalities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Concurrency:¬†Go's built-in concurrency primitives, like goroutines and channels, make writing highly concurrent and efficient backend code easy.</li>
<li>Networking:¬†Go provides robust networking support, making it suitable for building network-related applications, including network protocols, servers, and clients.</li>
<li>Web Frameworks:¬†Go has web frameworks like Gin and Echo that simplify building robust web services with routing, middleware support, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of Golang:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Simplicity and Readability: Go's clean and minimalistic syntax promotes code readability and reduces unnecessary complexity. It encourages good coding practices and makes code easier to understand and maintain.</li>
<li>Concurrency Support: Go provides built-in support for concurrency with goroutines and channels, making it efficient for concurrent and parallel programming.</li>
<li>Strongly Typed and Statically Checked: It is statically typed, which means variable types are checked simultaneously, ensuring code reliability and reducing runtime errors.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Go is highly portable and compiles machine code, allowing developers to create cross-platform applications for various operating systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Database layer with PostgreSQL
</h2>

<p>PostgreSQL, often called Postgres, is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability and extensibility. It supports various data types, including JSON, and offers advanced features such as indexing, replication, and partitioning.</p>

<p>It is an ancient database management system and can be integrated with programming languages like Java, C, C++, etc. This feature allows developers to have customized functions.</p>

<p><strong>Features of PostgreSQL:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>ACID Compliance: PostgreSQL is fully ACID-compliant, ensuring data integrity and reliability, even in complex transactional scenarios.</li>
<li>Advanced Indexing: PostgreSQL provides various indexing methods, including B-tree, hash, and GiST (Generalized Search Tree), allowing developers to optimize queries for multiple data types.</li>
<li>Concurrency Control: PostgreSQL can handle concurrent access because of its Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) system. This means that multiple users can access and modify data without conflicts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of using PostgreSQL:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Rich features and extensions: Robust features of PostgreSQL, like Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), recovery, granular access controls, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions, and a refined query planner/optimizer make it stand out from other databases.</li>
<li>Reliability and standards compliance: The large base of open source contributors lends it a built-in community support network. It's highly fault-tolerant, and since it's an ancient db, troubleshooting is also easy.</li>
<li>Easy to use: You only need a little training before getting your hands dirty on PostgreSQL. It's pretty easy to learn.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  DevOps/Deployment on Kubernetes with Rig.dev
</h2>

<p>Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for how modern companies scale their applications. Developers interact with Kubernetes in one of two ways: either they are exposed to Kubernetes themselves either natively through something like Helm and Terraform, or they are working with an abstraction layer that takes control of the entire cluster, leaving no room to go out of the box without fragile external dependencies.</p>

<p>While the former gives flexibility for complex solutions, it enforces a high learning curve with no abstractions. The latter, on the other hand, removes the flexibility that is often needed when scaling or building complex solutions.</p>

<p>This is where Rig.dev comes into the picture!</p>

<p>Rig.dev¬†is an open-source application platform for Kubernetes, designed to eliminate its inherent complexities. It seeks to empower developers with a developer-friendly deployment engine that simplifies rolling out, managing, debugging, and scaling applications on Kubernetes. With features like Capsules and Rollouts, a slick Dashboard, and a CLI for terminal operations, Rig.dev aims to provide developers with powerful and intuitive tools.</p>

<p>Rig.dev is not just another platform; it's the vision for the future of application development. It promises an application platform that evolves with your needs, all while ensuring the freedom to choose and transition between any cloud provider that supports Kubernetes.</p>

<p><strong>Features of Rig.dev:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Capsules:¬†Rig.dev comes with a deployment engine that wraps resources in what we call¬†<em>Capsules</em>. A Capsule contains a bundle of resources that will be deployed as a unit.</li>
<li>Rollouts:¬†Deployments of a build to a specific environment and network configuration. Rollouts are immutable and are used to manage the lifecycle of the application.</li>
<li>Dashboard and CLI compatible:¬†Rig.dev provides a Dashboard that easily lets developers work with Application resources and the CLI where all operations are available.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of Rig.dev:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Capsules and Rollouts are modern takes on developer-friendly abstractions.</li>
<li>Deploy well-configured applications in Kubernetes without the complexity.</li>
<li>CI/CD pipelines that seamlessly integrate with GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>Having both Dashboard and CLI increases the development experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  A promise is a debt
</h2>

<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://dev.to/marcelluscaio/using-rem-doesnt-make-your-website-responsive-heres-why-4b0e">I wrote about some typography tips</a>. We discussed the importance of using the REM unit and how to make our fonts responsive using Media Queries. With that, you can already create impeccable web projects in terms of font size. But I promised to talk about making fonts responsive without using Media Queries, and a promise is a debt. So, here we go!</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q8LYksrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lly5ctf7jqgs8zjg9fy0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q8LYksrf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lly5ctf7jqgs8zjg9fy0.jpg" alt="Image description" width="484" height="720"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The limits of Media Queries
</h2>

<p>When we adapt font sizes using media queries, our fonts remain the same size until they reach the breakpoint, and only then they change.</p>

<p>Open the CodePen below and adjust the screen width to see the sudden change in font size.</p>

<p><iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/embed/XWopvde?height=600&amp;default-tab=result&amp;embed-version=2">
</iframe>
<br>
<a href="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/pen/XWopvde">Open the CodePen in another tab.</a></p>

<p>Using the fluid typography technique, our font will always adjust to the screen size. For every pixel the screen increases, there will be an increment in font size.</p>

<p>"Caio, what kind of witchcraft is this? How is that possible?"</p>

<p>It's not witchcraft, but a powerful CSS function: clamp().</p>
<h2>
  
  
  Getting to know 'clamp()'
</h2>

<p>With clamp(), we can define a minimum value, an ideal value, and a maximum value.</p>

<p>Let's say we want our font to be 16px on a screen width of 320px and 32px on a screen width of 1920px. Our clamp() would look something like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">clamp</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">1</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nt">valor</span> <span class="nt">ideal</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="err">2</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c">/*
You noticed that we're using REM, right?
No PX for fonts, remember?
*/</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>What about the ideal value? Well, since we want our font to adapt to the screen size, we'll use one of the viewport units, VW. 100vw is the size of the screen, and 1vw is 1% of the screen width. On a 320px screen, 100vw is 320px, and 1vw equals 3.2px.</p>

<p>Let's temporarily use the value of 5vw.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">clamp</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">1</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="err">5</span><span class="nt">vw</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="err">2</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>With this, our font still has those minimum and maximum limits of 16px and 32px (based on the browser's default font), but with 5vw as the ideal value, it will always try to be 5vw in size.</p>

<p>Let's see some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a 300px screen: 5vw would be 15px. 15px is less than 16px - our minimum font size. In this case, the font would be 16px.</p>

<p>On a 320px screen: 5vw would be 16px. The font used would be 16px.</p>

<p>On a 500px screen: 5vw would be 25px. 25px is greater than 16px, and it's less than the maximum limit of 32px. So, the font used would be 25px.</p>

<p>On a 1000px screen: 5vw would be 50px. Since this value is greater than our limit, the font used would be 32px.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See this applied in the example below:</p>

<p><iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/embed/eYbvYyZ?height=600&amp;default-tab=result&amp;embed-version=2">
</iframe>
</p>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/pen/eYbvYyZ">Open the CodePen in another tab.</a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Not everything is perfect
</h3>

<p>We have two problems here:</p>

<p>1) Our font is growing too quickly in this example. It reached our limit at a screen width of 640px, but we wanted it to vary fluidly up to 1920px. It becomes static for 1280px! </p>

<p>2) Using a font based solely on viewport units poses an accessibility problem. Try going back to the previous CodePen and zoom in on the screen. Users cannot zoom in on the font, which remains frozen since it's based on the screen size. You'll notice that the text in the center of the screen doesn't change in size, while the screen and font size counter in the upper-left corner increases.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Using VW + REM
</h2>

<p>A technique that helps with these two problems is to define the ideal value, the one in the middle of the clamp(), not just in VW, but as a sum of VW and REM.</p>

<p>Let's use the following values:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nt">clamp</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">1</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="err">8</span><span class="nt">rem</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="err">1</span><span class="nt">vw</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="err">2</span><span class="nt">rem</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>See in the example below that the font starts to grow exactly after 320px and stops just before 1920px!</p>

<p><iframe height="600" src="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/embed/MWZpYwJ?height=600&amp;default-tab=result&amp;embed-version=2">
</iframe>
</p>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/marcelluscaio/pen/MWZpYwJ">Open the CodePen in another tab.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83hglD5s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgq82nvo82r82fhvy5et.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--83hglD5s--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fgq82nvo82r82fhvy5et.gif" alt="Image description" width="640" height="420"></a></p>

<p>"Caio, you're a genius! How did you come up with that value?"</p>

<p>I hate to disappoint you, dear reader, but I didn't do this calculation in my head! There is a formula to calculate this ideal value, and all the explanations for that will be in one of the articles I'll leave in the references. In this example and in my daily work, I use a tool that calculates it for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator">You can access this tool here.</a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Fluid Type Calculator
</h3>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9yFI9-yH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2exkk76jg2ft60qinjnl.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9yFI9-yH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2exkk76jg2ft60qinjnl.png" alt="Image description" width="502" height="540"></a></p>

<p>Here, we can define the minimum and maximum screen widths and the minimum and maximum font sizes ‚Äî let's just ignore the Type Scale option for now.</p>

<p>The tool provides the clamp() values for you. Then, just add them to your code, and you're good to go.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Dealing with multiple font sizes simultaneously
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Caio, I've never worked on a project with just one font size!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know, I know. The example with only one font size was to make things simple. But there's no catch 22 here. Let's apply this logic to our first example, the one with fonts using Media Queries.</p>

<p>There, we had the following font model:</p>

<p>Level 1 -&gt; 16px to 18px;</p>

<p>Level 2 -&gt; 20px to 24px;</p>

<p>Level 3 -&gt; 25px to 32px;</p>

<p>Level 4 -&gt; 31px to 42px;</p>

<p>Now we just need to use our calculator for each of these ranges!</p>

<p>Previously, we had:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="nd">:root</span><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">--fs-1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1.125rem</span><span class="p">;</span>

</div>



<p>Now we end up with this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

<h2>
  
  
  Ok, what about the Type Scale Thing?
</h2>

<p>As developers, we often don't take part in the font size selection process. Designers usually lead that decision. "And how do they do that?", you might be wondering.</p>

<p>That's a science of its own. There are different systems: the 4-point grid, the 8-point grid, Google's Material Design, and many others. None of these systems can do without the trained eyes of design professionals: systems are not magic and often require adaptations.</p>

<p>One of these systems is modular scale typography. In this system, we start with a font size and increase or decrease it based on a multiplication factor. For example, let's say our smallest font is 10px, and the multiplication factor is 2. Our font system could have the following values: 10px, 20px, 40px, 80px, and so on. This example is exaggerated for didactic purposes, of course.</p>

<p>This methodology adds objectivity to font size selection and helps make our typography hierarchy more consistent.</p>

<p>The Type Scale field in our calculator helps generate fonts using this type of methodology. Let's say I have a project with 4 font levels (4 different sizes), and the smallest font should be 14px on mobile and 20px on monitors.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YIX4cePz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9dkwqsii1rncstt1uh46.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YIX4cePz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9dkwqsii1rncstt1uh46.png" alt="Image description" width="780" height="233"></a></p>

<p>Here, I'm applying a growth rate of 1.25 on 320px screens while applying a growth rate of 1.414 on 1900px screens. The result is as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vnqHnXTS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gtl9wqlpbpl5g383h2xu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vnqHnXTS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gtl9wqlpbpl5g383h2xu.png" alt="Image description" width="780" height="297"></a></p>

<p>Note that font sizes grow much faster on the 1900px screen because we used a higher rate. I invite you to read the excellent articles on modular typography scales that will be in the references of this article to better understand when to choose which rate for your scale. I also encourage you to generate and test different scales and compare the results. What happens when the scale rate is higher on larger screens than on smaller screens? What happens when the rate is the same? And when it's smaller?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>We've learned how to apply the fluid typography technique using CSS. Fluid typography is an elegant solution that brings visual integrity to your project on various screens.</p>

<p>Always remember that accessibility is a priority. To ensure your website is accessible, always test it with a 200% zoom.</p>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>As iOS developers, we spend most of our time at work in the Xcode. To put it into perspective‚Ää-‚ÄäIt's about <strong>20‚Äì35 hours per week</strong>! What if I told you that you may use this time <strong>inefficiently</strong>, and you can <strong>optimise</strong> it?</p>

<p>Imagine having an elevator in your house, but still using stairs to get to the top floor.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6W1-PhLv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w1z14m4mrn5li8drwmro.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6W1-PhLv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w1z14m4mrn5li8drwmro.gif" alt="Image description" width="400" height="400"></a></p>

<p>At the end of the day, you'll reach the same floor, but at the cost of <strong>time</strong> and <strong>exhaustion</strong>. The same is applicable to using Xcode without shortcuts.<br>
¬†<br>
In this article, I'll show you a few <strong>Xcode shortcuts</strong> that will boost your productivity and elevate your skills in writing code.</p>

<p>We'll separate them by <strong>Project View and Navigation</strong>, <strong>Code Editing</strong>, and <strong>Project Build</strong> sections. Some of them might be well-known, and some‚Ää-‚Ääcan be new to you, but I'm sure all of those mentioned are essential to every iOS developer.</p>

<p>Plus, there's a very helpful <strong>bonus</strong> at the end of the article üëÄ</p>

<p>First things first, let's agree on the dictionary of the symbols. In this article, I'll follow this setup:<br>
<strong>‚åò ‚Äì Command</strong> key<br>
<strong>‚åÉ ‚Äì Control</strong> or Ctrl key<br>
<strong>‚å• ‚Äì Option</strong> or Alt key<br>
<strong>‚áß ‚Äì Shift</strong> key</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Project View and Navigation
</h2>

<p>In this section, we'll focus on the shortcuts that will help you to navigate through your Xcode project and understand its file system way faster than you used to.</p>

<p>The first one is <strong>‚åò + ‚áß + O</strong>. To open a file by its name, just press this combination, type the filename, and you'll see a list of options matching your input.You can search by class/struct name and methods declaration.This is the fastest way of getting around the big projects when trying to find something, especially when onboarding into a new project.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8thU9IlF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66sxingkrfqc4ljbqsh3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8thU9IlF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/66sxingkrfqc4ljbqsh3.png" alt="Search window with multiple options" width="800" height="719"></a></p>

<p>The next one is <strong>‚åò + J</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääfocus on a file in the navigator. It's very helpful while working on projects with complex structures‚Ää-‚Ääyou can easily end up in some unknown location, and this shortcut will show you exactly where you are right now.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + N</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääcreate a new file. A common shortcut for all IDEs, but in combination with the previous one, you can create a new file in the right place of your project very fast.</p>

<p><strong>‚áß + ‚åò + Y</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääshow/hide debug area. Also comes in very handy for quickly accessing the debug area view.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚å• + Enter</strong>‚Ää-‚Äätoggle SwiftUI Preview/Canvas. While working with SwiftUI, this one is helpful to toggle the additional Previews view when needed.</p>

<p><strong>^ + ‚åò+ J</strong>‚Ää-‚ÄäJump to the definition. After selecting a property or function, just use this shortcut, and it will navigate you to the definition of the selection.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚åÉ + left/right arrows</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääjump between the previous and next opened file.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚áß + 0 (zero)</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääshow a documentation view. I encourage you to use this one from time to time or when dealing with some unknown Swift issues, Apple's documentation is very user-friendly and easy to navigate through.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Code Editing
</h2>

<p>Now we'll focus on how to boost your code editing with shortcuts.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚åÉ+ E‚Ää</strong>-‚ÄäSelect all in scope. Very useful shortcut for refactoring small chunks of code in a local scope. Let's say you've misspelled your property name, and you want to fix it quickly in all local-scope usages. You can do so by selecting a word and using this shortcut:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUwwzUrb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7cysnthhb1k8x102709.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jUwwzUrb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q7cysnthhb1k8x102709.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="503"></a></p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚å• + E</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääfind in the current file. Just select a word and press this shortcut to jump to the next usage of this word.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5QlehCBp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yqnuvkrpzveq0xmi30ox.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5QlehCBp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yqnuvkrpzveq0xmi30ox.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="503"></a></p>

<p>But be careful, this shortcut is <strong>case-insensitive</strong> and matches by parts, not the whole word.</p>

<p><strong>‚åÉ + I</strong>‚Ää-‚ÄäRe-indent code. After making some changes to your functions, you may notice that code indentation can mess up. Use this shortcut to quickly fix your code.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚å• + Up/Down arrows</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääfold/unfold method or class. It will cover the selected part of the code. Very helpful to use this in big and complicated parts of code, just in order to focus on what's important right now.</p>

<p><strong>‚åò + ‚å• + /</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääcreate a documentation. It just pastes a documentation template right above the selection, which is way faster than writing it all by yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--grXCN0NP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ipf3oe8k1v3lr5jskzj5.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--grXCN0NP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ipf3oe8k1v3lr5jskzj5.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="298"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Project build
</h2>

<p>As for the project build shortcuts, I consider these most helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>‚åò + R</strong>‚Ää-‚Äärun current target</li>
<li>
<strong>‚åò + B</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääbuild current target</li>
<li>
<strong>‚åò + U</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääbuild and run testing target. Add <strong>‚áß</strong> (<strong>‚åò + ‚áß + U</strong>) to just build without running. Or add <strong>‚åÉ</strong> (<strong>‚åò + ‚åÉ+ U</strong>) to skip building when it's not needed</li>
<li>
<strong>‚åÉ + ‚å• + ‚åò + G</strong> -re-run a previous test case. Very helpful while fixing just one problematic test. If your last testing action was running the whole class, it will run the whole class again</li>
<li>
<strong>‚åò + ‚áß + K</strong>‚Ää-‚Ääclean build</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  Bonus time!
</h2>

<p>For a quick multiline change in your code, you can use <strong>‚åÉ + ‚áß + up/down arrows</strong>. This way, you will activate a multiline cursor, which can be very handy for refactoring chunks of code without repetitions. And, to make it sound even better, you can use <strong>mouse clicks</strong> to select the specific parts of lines to edit!</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oaHDm91E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yexpe54go29xgsdq86jm.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oaHDm91E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yexpe54go29xgsdq86jm.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="334"></a></p>

<p>I can guarantee that after using it a few times, you'll love it and will not imagine your Xcode development without this shortcut!</p>

<p>And also, as a bonus-bonus, you can change and create your own shortcuts in Xcode. To do so, go to Xcode ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Key Bindings.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gACnbSSJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8d3p2u1q3urqp7d6zyp.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--gACnbSSJ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8d3p2u1q3urqp7d6zyp.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="570"></a><br>
Be careful not to use some macOS system shortcuts though, because the OS will treat it with a bigger priority</p>




<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, I'd say that the usage of the Xcode shortcuts is a pretty good marker of how proficient a developer is. After hosting multiple iOS job interviews with live coding/debugging sessions, I always paid attention when an interviewee was using them. It shows that the person is not totally new to iOS development and is interested in becoming more proficient by learning how to use a tool a bit more than just creating a project and being able to run it.</p>

<p>And that's it! I hope you've learned something new from this article and that I've helped you become an even more productive iOS Developer than you were before.¬†</p>

<p>Have I missed some interesting shortcuts? Let me know in the comments, let's learn together!</p>

 #### - [Using Node.js for Automated Testing with Headless Browsers](https://dev.to/saint_vandora/using-nodejs-for-automated-testing-with-headless-browsers-5g8) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In the fast-paced world of web development, ensuring the reliability and functionality of web applications is paramount. Automated testing is an essential practice that helps developers catch bugs and regressions early in the development process. One of the powerful tools in the arsenal of automated testing is Node.js, which, when combined with headless browsers, provides an efficient and flexible testing environment. </p>

<p>In this article, we will explore how to leverage Node.js for automated testing with headless browsers to streamline the testing process and deliver high-quality web applications.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Understanding Headless Browsers
</h2>

<p>Headless browsers are web browsers without a graphical user interface (GUI). They can be controlled programmatically, making them ideal for automated testing. Unlike traditional browsers like Chrome or Firefox, which require manual interactions, headless browsers execute commands via code. This means you can run tests without any visual distractions and on a server or a continuous integration (CI) system without any GUI overhead.</p>

<p><strong>Popular headless browsers include:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Puppeteer:</strong> Developed by Google, <a href="https://pptr.dev/category/guides">Puppeteer</a> is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for controlling headless Chrome or Chromium browsers. It's widely used for web scraping and automated testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Playwright:</strong> Created by Microsoft, <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> supports multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It provides a unified API for browser automation, making it a versatile choice for testing across different browsers.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Leveraging Node.js for Automated Testing
</h2>

<p>Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, is well-suited for automated testing due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Combining Node.js with headless browsers allows you to write tests in JavaScript, simplifying the testing process and making it accessible to a broader audience of developers.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Setting Up Your Environment
</h3>

<p>To get started, you'll need to set up your testing environment:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Install Node.js:</strong> If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website (<a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Choose a Headless Browser:</strong> Select a headless browser library like <a href="https://pptr.dev/category/guides">Puppeteer</a> or <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> based on your project requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Initialize Your Project:</strong> Create a new Node.js project and install the chosen headless browser library using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm</a> or <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started">yarn</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>
  
  
  Writing Automated Tests
</h3>

<p>Now that your environment is set up, you can start writing automated tests. Here's a basic example using Puppeteer:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () =&gt; {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // Your testing logic goes here

  await browser.close();
})();
