</h2>

<p>In my last article, I showed you how you can use Python and Folium to create an interactive app to showcase all your outdoor activities:<br>

<p>Now you've created a captivating map that brings your outdoor activities to life. You can use those maps to visually retrace your journeys, celebrate your progress, and relive those adventures.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GVlXge8a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8z23bkkjvsjifz5v70by.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GVlXge8a--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8z23bkkjvsjifz5v70by.png" alt="" width="800" height="555"></a></p>

<p>But what good is it if only you can see it?</p>

<p>Are you ready to showcase your adventures to the world? In this next story, I'll walk you through the process of deploying your interactive map to AWS using Terraform. This tool is great for managing infrastructure as code, and we'll go through the necessary steps to provision and configure the resources needed for your map to be accessible to anyone with an internet connection. By utilizing S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and CloudFront, we'll create a solution that is simple to deploy and maintain.</p>

<p>So get ready to share your outdoor accomplishments with loved ones and fellow outdoor enthusiasts all across the globe!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Solution
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Q-lnArN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ykkdze89r4kymegjngm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Q-lnArN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6ykkdze89r4kymegjngm.png" alt="" width="800" height="362"></a></p>

<p>As you can see our solution consists of multiple elements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At its core, we have two S3 buckets, one for input and another for output. The input bucket becomes the repository for your GPX files, where you'll store the raw material of your outdoor activities. Whenever a new GPX file is uploaded, an EventBridge event is triggered, signaling the arrival of fresh data.</p></li>
<li><p>This is where the Lambda function steps onto the stage. It takes the newly arrived GPX file, parses it to extract the essential trail data, and plots the trails on the map. The Lambda function then creates the HTML of the map and places it into the output bucket, ready to be shared with the world.</p></li>
<li><p>To guarantee swift and seamless access to the map, we use CloudFront. This service acts as a content distribution network that caches and delivers the output buckets content to users globally from edge locations. It reduces latency and improves performance.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Terraform?
</h2>

<p><a href="http://terraform.io">Terraform</a> is an open-source infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code, making it easy to provision and manage resources across multiple cloud providers. With Terraform, you can ensure consistent and repeatable deployments, making it an ideal choice for automating your cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Setting Up the Environment
</h2>

<p>Before we begin, ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads?product_intent=terraform">the official website</a> and follow the installation instructions.</p>

<p>You will also have to install the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/en/cli/">AWS CLI</a> and have to configure it so that you can deploy to your AWS account. I wrote a <a href="https://towardsdev.com/my-wsl-setup-as-a-cloud-dev-getting-the-best-of-both-worlds-a0b3a74c14ad">story on using the Windows Subsystem</a> on this.</p>

<p>Once you have Terraform installed, create a new directory for your project and place the main.tf file provided above in this directory. This file contains the Terraform configuration that describes the resources we need to deploy the map.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Provisioning AWS Resources
</h2>

<p>Our map requires several AWS resources to be provisioned, such as S3 buckets for storing the website files, an AWS Lambda function to generate the map, and a CloudFront distribution to serve the map securely and efficiently.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Buckets
</h3>

<p>We'll use S3 buckets to store the website files and the map generated by the Lambda function. The provided Terraform code uses the terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket module to create the buckets.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>data "http" "mime_types" {
  url = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lkrimphove/46988dc2ac63ad5ad9c95e6109e3c37e/raw/2349abeb136f1f8dbe91c661c928a5ce859432f9/mime.json"
  request_headers = {
    Accept = "application/json"
  }
}

locals {
  mime_types = jsondecode(data.http.mime_types.response_body)
}



### BUCKETS

module "input_bucket" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"

  bucket = var.input_bucket
  acl    = "private"

  control_object_ownership = true
  object_ownership         = "ObjectWriter"

}

module "output_bucket" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws"

  bucket = var.output_bucket
  acl    = "private"

  control_object_ownership = true
  object_ownership         = "ObjectWriter"
}

resource "aws_s3_object" "object" {
  for_each     = fileset("../src/website", "*")
  bucket       = module.output_bucket.s3_bucket_id
  key          = each.value
  acl          = "private"
  source       = "../src/website/${each.value}"
  content_type = lookup(local.mime_types, split(".", each.value)[1], null)
  etag         = filemd5("../src/website/${each.value}")
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  Lambda Function
</h3>

<p>The Lambda function is the heart of our map generation process. It takes the GPX data from the S3 bucket, processes it, and generates an interactive map. We'll use the terraform-aws-modules/lambda module to create and manage the Lambda function.<br>
</p>

<p>To serve the map with low latency and high performance, we'll use CloudFront, AWS's content delivery network (CDN). CloudFront caches the map in edge locations worldwide, reducing the load on the origin server (our S3 bucket). We'll use the terraform-aws-modules/cloudfront module to create the CloudFront distribution.<br>

<h2>
  
  
  Deploying Your Map
</h2>

<p>Create a deploy.tfvars.json file and change the values to fit your map (you have to change the bucket names, as those have to be globally unique):<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>{
    "input_bucket": "outdoor-activities-input",
    "output_bucket": "outdoor-activities-output",
    "start_latitude": "48.13743",
    "start_longitude": "11.57549",
    "zoom_start": "10"
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Create a output.tf file (this will print out information to the console):<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>output "cloudfront_distribution_domain_name" {
    value = module.cloudfront.cloudfront_distribution_domain_name
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Once you've set up the Terraform environment and configured the main.tf and deploy.tfvar.json files, run the following commands in your terminal:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Initialize Terraform: <br>
terraform init</p></li>
<li><p>Plan the deployment to see what resources will be created:<br>
terraform plan -var-file=‚Äûdeploy.tfvars.json‚Äú</p></li>
<li><p>Apply the changes to provision the resources:<br>
terraform apply -var-file=‚Äûdeploy.tfvars.json‚Äú</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Terraform will show you a summary of the changes that will be made. If everything looks good, type yes to apply the changes. Terraform will now create all the necessary AWS resources for your map. You will find your URL in the console.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to upload your GPX files to the input bucket. Make sure to keep this file structure:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>    input-bucket

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your interactive map of outdoor activities using Terraform and AWS. Your map is now accessible to the world, allowing others to explore your exciting adventures and celebrate your progress.</p>

<p>With Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach, you can easily manage and update your map in the future. You can add new activities by simple uploading new gpx files to the input bucket. If you want to modify the map's appearance, or enhance it with additional features, you can do all this with just a few changes to the Terraform configuration.</p>

<p>So go ahead, share your map with friends, family, and fellow outdoor enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Happy mapping!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What's Next?
</h2>

<p>You've learned the basics of deploying your map with Terraform. But there's so much more you can do to enhance your map and create an even richer experience for your audience:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Add your own domain to your CloudFront distribution for easier access.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't want to share your map with everybody? Control access to your map by adding authentication and authorization features with AWS Cognito.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up a continuous deployment pipeline to automatically update your map whenever you push code changes to your git-repo.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The possibilities are endless. Have fun exploring and expanding your outdoor activities map!</p>

<p>
  <strong>TL;DR</strong>
  <br>

<pre><code>We created a vscode extension to add emoji reactions, even 

with comments, to any line of code of any Git repo! React and 

see others reactions to any piece of code straight from your

IDE, and have them follow (or not üòâ) the code through 
changes.
</code></pre>




</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The story behind
</h2>

<p>After almost a decade of writing code in all sorts of environments, in a small startup or in a big enterprise with thousands of developers, we always felt <code>that there were some things that should be alongside our code, but never could be</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Giving and receiving feedback for your code</strong>. As developers we <em>learn from others</em>, and their reaction to our code either that being a üëç, üëé or sometimes even a üí© or a üöÄ, is invaluable to our progress. Unfortunately, apart from reviews we don't really get the chance to tell someone what we think about their code.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Putting a mark or a note in the code</strong>. You are going about your task and suddenly you notice a piece of code that has that <code>smell</code>, or just <code>doesn't look right</code>, or is <code>outdated</code>, or uses an <code>old syntax</code>, or looks like it could even be <code>an issue</code>. Now your choices are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the task you are doing and fix it </li>
<li>Create an issue somewhere to come back to it at another time (or forever forget)</li>
<li>Do it with your task (<em>ouch!</em>)</li>
<li>Leaving a comment in the code and puzzling yourself a few months down the line, when the code has moved/changed, with the quiz <em>"what was I referring to here"</em>.</li>
</ol>


</li>
<li><p>Code quality metrics are very cool <em>as a concept</em>! However once used we all know that they feel a bit neither here nor there. Eg is a code bad if it has high complexity? Maybe, maybe not! I'd like to <strong>know what my collaborators thinks of the code</strong>, which parts are for a üòç and which for a ü§î and which repos and files are the ones that might need a look into cause üí© has started pilling on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's why we wanted to make something that's:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source üíö (share the love!)</li>
<li>It works in the <strong>IDE</strong>
</li>
<li>You can add <strong>emojis</strong> and <strong>comments</strong> üöÄ</li>
<li>You can see others <strong>emojis</strong> and <strong>comments</strong> üëÄ</li>
<li>
<strong>Follows (or leaves) the code</strong> as it changes </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  What we built
</h2>

<p>We built an IDE extension (vscode only for the time being,<br>
Intellij is in the works) that allows you to add emoji <br>
reactions, even with comments, to any line of code of any Git<br>
repo! </p>

<p>You can react and see others reactions to any piece of code straight from your IDE! </p>

<p>And <code>Reactions follow the code!</code>, meaning that it stays there for as long as the relevant line has not changed - <em>whitespace doesn't count as change</em> - and they get removed from the line when it's changed.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>first version</strong>, so it supports limited amount of emojis for now, and it has only a few features. We are super excited to have the community shape the tool and decide on the new features by contributing on GitHub</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Different ways to see reactions</strong> and add yours (status bar, inline decoration, annotations, reactions feed panel)</li>
<li>
<strong>Notifications</strong> on new reactions (either on the repo or specifically on your lines)</li>
<li>We didn't want to bloat the IDE, so we created a <strong>lightweight website</strong> for all the views we didn't feel belonged in the IDE (ie cross-repo data) so you are able to get information for all your projects.</li>

 #### - [Don‚Äôt compare and compete with others, instead collaborate](https://dev.to/gregorojstersek/dont-compare-and-compete-with-others-instead-collaborate-b8j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>If you are a person who likes to compare and compete with your colleagues. Let me tell you one important thing. Don't compare or compete, instead help and collaborate.</p>

<p>Being a lone wolf and just focusing on yourself and your progress will certainly get you somewhere. But rather than trying to do everything yourself. You have a group of like-minded people who are all on the same path as you!</p>

<p>Your progression is going to be much:</p>

<ul>
<li>faster,</li>
<li>more exciting,</li>
<li>more fulfilling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compete only with yourself and try to get better every day!</p>

<p>The software development world is smaller than you think. Collaborating and helping each other instead of competing puts you in a position where fellow like-minded people can help you find opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>A practical example</strong></p>

<p>If you are searching for a new role, the best way to find it is to get recommended for the position.</p>

<p>If someone from my team recommends a candidate.</p>

<p>I already know 2 things:</p>

<p>He/she already is familiar to an extent with a person on my team, so the collaboration and onboarding would be easier.</p>

<p>He/she has already shown to some extent capability to be able to do the job.</p>

<p>This gives you much better chances right from the start. Make sure to help each other to grow and progress in careers!</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
