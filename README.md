 #### - [The Roadmap to Web Dev Mastery (Best Resources)](https://dev.to/codewithshahan/the-roadmap-to-web-dev-mastery-best-resources-2o1m) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>The reality of today's web development landscape is far more complex. Vanilla CSS and JavaScript are no longer the norm for building web apps; instead, there's a myriad of frameworks and libraries. This choice can be bewildering for beginners. Moreover, once you've picked a technology to learn, the question looms: How can you efficiently acquire these skills for free?</p>

<p>By the end of this journey, you'll not only find answers to these questions but also discover a treasure trove of free resources to transform from a complete beginner into a <a href="https://youtu.be/vRsJH-GjHsQ">capable web developer</a>. Additionally, I'll unveil three critical mistakes you should avoid. </p>

<p>But before we delve into the intricacies of various technologies, let's grasp the fundamental workings of a website.</p>

<p><em>You can watch my YT video regarding to this article:</em><br>
<iframe width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_s71XCQ7BbQ">
</iframe>
</p>

<h2>
  
  
  üèó How Website Works
</h2>

<p>At its core, a website is simply a collection of files stored on a server. These files can be accessed through a web browser like Chrome or Firefox, which sends requests to the server via the internet. The server, in turn, may execute operations such as storing relevant data using a database. </p>

<p>When you're coding for what users see in their browsers, you're venturing into front-end development. Conversely, if you're coding for the server's actions upon receiving requests, you're diving into back-end development. You can choose to master both aspects, so you'll become a full-stack developer, but keep in mind that excelling in just one of these domains is a valuable achievement in itself.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  ü•¢Fronted Mastery
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  HTML &amp; CSS
</h3>

<p>Let's commence with front-end development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript serve as the foundational building blocks in this realm. To comprehend their roles, consider a "Sign In" button on Netflix. HTML declares the button's existence to the browser, CSS specifies that it should be red with white text, and JavaScript dictates the actions to be taken upon clicking the button. However, there's a common pitfall here‚Äîspending excessive time on tutorials for these languages. </p>

<p>Learning by doing is the key, and interactive platforms like W3Schools are your allies. For HTML, work through exercises until you reach HTML graphics. Cover everything up to the CSS grid for CSS and explore the JS HTML DOM for JavaScript. Test your knowledge with quizzes and exercises.</p>

<p>CSS has a reputation for being time-consuming and challenging to debug, as it doesn't provide explicit error messages. To tackle this, consider employing a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Bootstrap offers pre-built components, but customization can be limited, and your site may look generic. In contrast, Tailwind CSS grants you greater control over aesthetics and boasts excellent documentation. To master it, learn how to create custom components with Tailwind CSS.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  JavaScript
</h3>

<p>Switching gears to JavaScript, we aim to optimize our workflow. When using JavaScript to build a project, you'll notice that HTML and JavaScript reside in separate files, requiring multiple updates when modifying a component. This disjointed workflow can hinder productivity. To address this issue, we turn to JavaScript frameworks, with two popular choices being Angular and React. Angular, a full-fledged framework, has a steep learning curve, while React, a flexible JavaScript library, is more beginner-friendly, especially if you've already grasped JavaScript. Dive into React using the official "Intro to React" tutorial to build a tic-tac-toe game, and then explore its main concepts.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Building Portfolio
</h2>

<p>With a solid grasp of front-end development, it's time to assemble your portfolio. This brings us to another significant mistake‚Äîcreating a portfolio prematurely. Build more projects first. Select projects that resonate with your daily life, such as a note-taking web app or a workout tracker. The aim is to demonstrate your ability to create functional web apps, which will undoubtedly make you more appealing to potential employers.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  üíªBackend Mastery
</h2>

<p>If you've absorbed all this knowledge and become a proficient front-end developer, you could consider your journey complete. However, if you hunger for more, it's time to delve into back-end development. In the realm of back-end development, you write code for servers to perform operations like data storage, retrieval, or interfacing with other servers. Java with Spring and Python with Django are viable options, but for a swifter route, Node.js with JavaScript is recommended. Leveraging your existing JavaScript knowledge, Node.js offers a seamless transition to server-side programming.</p>

<p>Node.js enables you to run JavaScript on servers, facilitating the backend logic while using JavaScript code. Express, a popular library, simplifies backend development. Begin by building an app from scratch with Express and MongoDB, a NoSQL database, using tutorials like the one by Traversy Media. Embrace the learning process by tackling challenges, referring to documentation, and seeking help online‚Äîthe skills you acquire now will serve you well as a software engineer.</p>

<p>To complete the journey, build a WhatsApp clone by following a beginner-friendly tutorial. Return to the front-end projects you created and integrate a backend. You now possess the skills and a portfolio of projects and are ready to seek job opportunities. Beware, though‚Äîmany aspiring developers stumble at the final hurdle by neglecting interview preparation. While smaller companies may hire based on skills alone, larger organizations conduct interviews with specific questions. Don't let your hard-earned skills go to waste; equip yourself with the knowledge and techniques required for successful interviews.</p>

<p><em><strong>Bright Data Can Help You Access the World of Web Data</strong></em><br>
Instead of wasting countless hours watching tutorials, why not take into account the priceless tool that <a href="https://get.brightdata.com/codewithshahan">Bright Data</a> provides? This amazing #1 web platform gives you the tools to convert webpages into structured data by giving you access to powerful web scrapers, award-winning proxy networks, and ready-to-use datasets for download. It is the top web data platform in the globe, and it will give your coding projects a boost.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  üòéConclusion
</h2>

<p>This concludes our journey. Remember, the path to becoming a proficient web developer is marked by hands-on learning, continuous improvement, and a commitment to honing your skills. Good luck on your coding adventure!</p>

 #### - [Cheerio & ChatGPT: A Primer on Web Scraping with Node.js](https://dev.to/bytebricks/cheerio-chatgpt-a-primer-on-web-scraping-with-nodejs-4klf) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hey there fellow data digger (we dig at <a href="https://bytebricks.ai/">bytebricks.ai</a>)! The web is a treasure trove of information waiting to be unearthed. And guess what? With a sprinkle of <a href="https://cheerio.js.org/">Cheerio</a> and a dash of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>, you can turn your code into a data-gathering wizard.</p>

<p>But, hey, let's add a fun twist to it! Ever heard of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a>? üòÇ This buddy can take a peek at HTML and whip up the Cheerio code you need to grab that data. Let‚Äôs dive into this delicious bowl of Cheerio (pun totally intended) and see how we can make web scraping a breeze.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Prepping Up
</h2>

<p>Before we start, make sure Node.js is comfortably nestled in your machine. Create a cozy little space for your project, hop into that directory via the terminal, and kickstart a new Node.js project with a simple:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm init -y
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Next up, let‚Äôs invite Cheerio and <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> (our trusty HTTP client) to the party with:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm install cheerio axios
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Snagging that HTML
</h2>

<p>Alright, with the gang all set, let‚Äôs nab the HTML of the website we‚Äôre eyeing. For this little adventure, we‚Äôre gonna pretend we‚Äôre extracting goodies from a make-believe e-commerce site.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const axios = require('axios');

async function fetchHTML(url) {
  const { data } = await axios.get(url);
  return data;
}

const url = 'https://fictional-ecommerce-site.com';
fetchHTML(url).then(console.log);
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Let Cheerio Lead the Way
</h2>

<p>Got the HTML? Sweet! Now, let‚Äôs hand it over to Cheerio for some parsing action.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const cheerio = require('cheerio');

async function parseHTML(html) {
  const $ = cheerio.load(html);

  // Let‚Äôs pretend each product is nestled
  $('.product').each((i, element) =&gt; {
    const title = $(element).find('.product-title').text();
    const price = $(element).find('.product-price').text();

    console.log(`${title}: ${price}`);
  });
}

fetchHTML(url).then(html =&gt; parseHTML(html));
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>See what we did there? It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre using <strong>jQuery!</strong>, but with the turbo engines of Node.js.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  ChatGPT comes handy
</h2>

<p>Now for the cherry on top! ChatGPT can take a look at HTML and conjure up the Cheerio code you need to snatch that data. Just feed it the HTML, and voila, you‚Äôve got your data extraction code ready to roll. It's like having a buddy who writes code while you munch on snacks!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Polishing Your Data Scooper
</h2>

<p>Crafting a web scraper is kinda like brewing the perfect cup of coffee. It needs a little tinkering to hit that sweet spot between speed and accuracy. With Cheerio, Node.js, and a little help from ChatGPT, you‚Äôve got a solid start. Don‚Äôt forget to handle those pesky paginations, asynchronous loads, and rate limits to scrape like a pro!üòé</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Further
</h2>

<p>You need to make data useful! at bytebricks we build using a Laravel backend and a Vue front, we find that fast to market and Laravel using SQL have a low ongoing overhead cost! not to mention the magic of <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent">Eloquent</a> as in this example of <a href="https://dev.to/bytebricks/unleashing-the-power-of-wherehas-in-laravel-jip">whereHas</a> or the very easy integration of <a href="https://dev.to/bytebricks/integrating-aws-simple-email-service-ses-with-laravel-a-comprehensive-guide-1lj3">AWS SES</a>!</p>

 #### - [Rants of a Beginner Techie3](https://dev.to/golden_builds/rants-of-a-beginner-techie3-326f) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hello and welcome to another episode of "Rants of a Beginner Techie!" It might seem a bit odd that I change my greeting each time, but I enjoy keeping things spontaneous.</p>

<p>Today, as usual, I've got a lot to talk about, and I hope you find something valuable or relatable in what I'm sharing.</p>

<p>Lately, I've been working on a project (it's a secret for now, but I'll reveal it once it's ready). This marks my first real portfolio project. Even though I know HTML, CSS, C, and I'm currently learning Python, this project feels distinct from the ones I did during courses or experiments while learning. It's challenging, and honestly, it feels a bit strange. At times, I even wonder if I'm a bit crazy because a voice in my head keeps saying, "Are you nuts? You'll never finish this!" But I'm not disheartened because I've learned a lot from my past failures. I've gained more programming knowledge and a deeper understanding of tech in general. I'm approaching this project with a startup mindset because I believe that portfolio projects should have a purpose. If I'm going to present them to potential employers, shouldn't they aim to solve real problems? With each passing day, I'm starting to see programming languages as tools for solving problems and building software. I'm building and learning because I want to solve problems I'm passionate about. What interests you? Find a problem and create a solution! Trust me; it's a fantastic way to create a perfect portfolio project. I'm putting my heart into this project.</p>

<p>To be honest, others may have already devised solutions to similar problems, but that shouldn't discourage you. Why? Because we're all unique, and my approach to solving a problem might differ from yours. In fact, I've learned a thing or two by observing someone else's approach, and I'm open to learning more!</p>

<p>I also noticed something else that I'd like to share in today's rant. Some months ago, I frequently experienced burnout, even though I read blogs and watched tech videos. I couldn't pinpoint the cause of my burnout until recently.</p>

<p>I had turned tech into an idol, making it a "do or die" for me. I stopped doing the things I loved and dedicated more time to learning. It's not that I wasn't happy learning new things, but I felt like I was losing myself. I no longer had time for other things I enjoyed. Burnout slowly crept in, and I felt drained every day. So, my advice to anyone reading this, especially beginner techies, is simple: "Just because you're pursuing a tech career or dream doesn't mean you should forget who you are or neglect your family and friends. Be yourself but with a touch of tech." This approach helped me prevent burnout because my mind no longer viewed it as a burdensome task.</p>

<p>Remember to have fun and enjoy the journey! I'm starting to realize that it's a journey, not just a destination.</p>

<p>I'll conclude today's episode with a quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Embrace the tech journey, but don't forget to dance to the rhythm of your own passions along the way."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed the article. You can reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Golden_builds">Twitter</a> or send me an email at <a href="mailto:goldisaac33@gmail.com">goldisaac33@gmail.com</a>. I appreciate you all. See you next time!</p>
