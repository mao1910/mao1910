 #### - [Want to Master BEM CSS Like a Pro? Check out this Ultimate Guide!](https://dev.to/jaimaldullat/want-to-master-bem-css-like-a-pro-check-out-this-ultimate-guide-1nj0) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Ever felt lost in a maze of CSS classes, unsure of where one style ends and another begins? You‚Äôre not alone. Many developers have faced the daunting task of untangling CSS, only to wish for a magic spell to make everything orderly.</p>

<p><strong>Enter BEM:</strong> the spellbook for writing cleaner, more readable class names in HTML and CSS. It‚Äôs not just a methodology; it‚Äôs a mindset shift. Dive in, and discover how BEM can transform chaos into clarity, and make your next project a breeze.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn the world of CSS, design is an art, but naming conventions? That‚Äôs pure science.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>




<h2>
  
  
  What is BEM?
</h2>

<p>BEM stands for <strong><em>Block</em></strong>, <strong><em>Element</em></strong>, <strong><em>Modifier</em></strong>. It‚Äôs a naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable class names in HTML and CSS. The main idea behind BEM is to divide the user interface into independent blocks, making it easier to maintain and scale your code.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Block</strong>: A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own. E.g., <code>header</code>, <code>container</code>, <code>menu</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Element</strong>: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block. E.g., <code>menu__item</code>, <code>header__logo</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modifier</strong>: A flag on a block or element used to change appearance or behaviour. E.g., <code>button--large</code>, <code>menu__item--active</code>.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  Why Use BEM?
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Modularity</strong>: BEM promotes the creation of independent blocks, making it easier to reuse code across different parts of your project or even different projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Clarity</strong>: With BEM, developers can easily discern the relationship between the HTML and CSS, reducing the learning curve for team members.</li>
<li>
<strong>Avoids specificity wars</strong>: Since BEM avoids nesting and relies on class names, you won‚Äôt find yourself battling with overly specific selectors.</li>
</ol>




<h2>
  
  
  How to Implement BEM
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Start with Blocks</strong>: Identify standalone entities in your design. These will be your blocks. For example, a navigation bar can be a block named <code>nav</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Identify Elements</strong>: Look within your blocks to find elements. Using our nav example, individual links would be elements. They can be named <code>nav__item</code>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Add Modifiers as Needed</strong>: If you have variations of a block or element, use a modifier. For instance, if one of the navigation links is the current page and you want to style it differently, you could use a modifier like <code>nav__item--active</code>.</li>
</ol>




<h2>
  
  
  BEM in Practice
</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate BEM:</p>

<p><strong>File: <code>index.html</code></strong><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight html"><code><span class="c">&lt;!-- Block --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;nav</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"nav"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Element --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"nav__item"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Home<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>

  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Element with Modifier --&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"nav__item nav__item--active"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>About<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"#"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"nav__item"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Contact<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Block (<code>&lt;nav class="nav"&gt;</code>)</strong>: This is the main container or parent component, which in this case is a navigation bar. It's given the class name <code>nav</code>, representing the block in BEM.</li>
<li>
<strong>Element (<code>&lt;a href="#" class="nav__item"&gt;</code>)</strong>: These are the individual links within the navigation bar. They are given the class name <code>nav__item</code>, where nav is the block name and item is the element name. The double underscores (__) indicate that item is an element of the nav block.</li>
<li>
<strong>Element with Modifier (<code>&lt;a href="#" class="nav__item nav__item--active"&gt;</code>)</strong>: This is also an individual link but with an additional class <code>nav__item--active</code>. The double hyphens (--) indicate a modifier. This modifier represents a variation of the <code>nav__item</code> element, which in this case is an active or currently selected link.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>File: <code>style.css</code></strong><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="c">/* Block */</span>
<span class="nc">.nav</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">background-color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">#333</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">padding</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Element */</span>
<span class="nc">.nav__item</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="no">white</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">text-decoration</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">none</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">margin-right</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1rem</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Modifier */</span>
<span class="nc">.nav__item--active</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">font-weight</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">bold</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>
<strong>Block (<code>.nav</code>)</strong>: This CSS rule targets the nav block. It sets a dark background color (#333) and a padding of 1rem around the navigation bar.</li>
<li>
<strong>Element (<code>.nav__item</code>)</strong>: This rule targets the nav__item elements, which are the individual links. It sets the text color to white, removes any underlines (text-decoration: none), and adds a margin to the right of each link (margin-right: 1rem).</li>
<li>
<strong>Modifier (<code>.nav__item--active</code>)</strong>: This rule targets the nav__item element with the --active modifier. It makes the font weight bold, indicating that this particular link is the active or currently selected link.</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  Tips for Using BEM
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Stay Consistent</strong>: Once you decide to use BEM, stick to its conventions throughout your project.</li>
<li>
<strong>Avoid Deep Nesting</strong>: The beauty of BEM is its flat structure. Avoid the temptation to nest elements within elements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Tools</strong>: There are pre-processors like SASS and LESS that can make working with BEM even more efficient.</li>
</ol>




<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>BEM is a powerful methodology that can bring clarity, consistency, and modularity to your CSS. While it might seem verbose at first, the benefits in terms of maintainability and scalability are immense. Give BEM a try in your next project and experience the difference for yourself!</p>

 #### - [How to Boost Your App's User Productivity](https://dev.to/intesar/how-to-boost-your-apps-user-productivity-1all) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>When you think about User Productivity, what comes to mind?</p>

<p>If you said ‚Äúa user/customer‚Äôs efficiency when using a software‚Äù, you‚Äôre on the right track.</p>

<p>User productivity is a measure of how efficiently a user or customer can accomplish their tasks and achieve their goals when using a software application.</p>

<p>In today's digital world, the efficiency and effectiveness with which users can navigate and interact with software are key determinants of overall user satisfaction, customer loyalty, and the success of an application.</p>

<p>You can ensure high user productivity by improving four key features of an application system:</p>

<p>App Performance: App performance encompasses the overall efficiency and responsiveness of an application. It includes factors like processing time, data retrieval speed, and the time it takes to send responses to the user. Applications with excellent performance not only respond quickly to user requests but also deliver a seamless and satisfying user experience, keeping users engaged and satisfied.<br>
Ease of access: A user-friendly interface and intuitive navigation contribute to ease of access. If it takes users too much time or effort to perform desired actions within the application, their productivity and efficiency will decrease, which can lead to user frustration and dissatisfaction.<br>
Error Handling: Error handling involves both the frequency of disruptions users encounter and the ability of the development team to patch and resolve these errors. A smooth and reliable application experience, with minimal errors, is crucial for maintaining user productivity and overall satisfaction.<br>
Availability of data: The availability of necessary data is essential for user productivity. Users must have easy access to the data they require to complete their tasks. Moreover, comprehensive documentation can help users navigate the application and make the most of its features, preventing productivity bottlenecks.<br>
To move users along a workflow (from start to finish in their journey within an application), you may optimize an application to provide high performance in all 4 of these aspects. Neglecting any one of them can result in diminished user productivity and potential dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>It's important to note that small improvements or declines in these key features can have a substantial impact.</p>

<p>For instance, a slight delay in action and reaction can reduce customer satisfaction by as much as 12% and may lead to a 19% drop in website traffic. If a user encounters two or more errors during their interaction with an application, it could result in an increase in churn by up to 40%.</p>

<p>Before the widespread use of cloud-base technology, companies were comfortable staying within their own boundaries or areas of expertise, rather than collaborating or integrating their services.</p>

<p>Users had to switch between different applications to complete their tasks or projects because those applications were not working together or providing seamless integration between their products.</p>

<p>The connection between API performance and user productivity is clear. When APIs perform well, they contribute to a more responsive, reliable, and efficient application, which, in turn, enhances the user's ability to complete tasks and achieve their objectives.</p>

<p>High API performance minimizes delays, reduces the likelihood of errors, and provides a more seamless experience for users. This, in turn, can positively impact user satisfaction, customer loyalty, and the overall success of the application.</p>

<p>Conversely, poor API performance can lead to user frustration, disruptions in workflow, and decreased productivity. Users may experience delays, errors, and overall dissatisfaction, which can result in reduced customer retention and increased churn.</p>

<p>To test these APIs and optimize performance, PerfAI provides a platform to proactively help you deliver high performance. With its no-code AI platform, you can triple your revenue and cut churn/drop rates significantly. You can sign-up for free here: <a href="https://app.perfai.ai">https://app.perfai.ai</a></p>

 #### - [GitHub Form Templates](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/github-form-templates-3n49) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>When you, as a contributor, want to create a new issue on GitHub, you're presented with a blank page and a text area to write your issue description.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZQSBgqqR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/91etaqlj12573n9nxdu3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZQSBgqqR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/91etaqlj12573n9nxdu3.png" alt="Empty issue" width="761" height="404"></a></p>

<p>If it's a feature request, you'd like to add all the relevant details and reasons why you think it's a good idea, to increase the chances of it being approved.</p>

<p>Speaking of nasty bugs, what you write in the issue body should hopefully be enough to let the maintainers understand what's going on and how to fix it and prevent similar issues in the future.</p>

<p>Everyone has their own way of writing issues and going in depth with details, which is great, but often times it's not the most efficient way.</p>

<p>In this 2 chapters series, we'll see how to use GitHub Issue Templates to help contributors write better issues.</p>

<p>You can find the full content in this video, or you can keep reading for Chapter 2.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Form Schema
</h2>

<p>The direct evolution of the markdown template is indeed the form schema. In short, it's a yaml file that describes the form fields and their properties.</p>

<p>The form what?</p>

<p>Yes, instead of letting the user create an issue on a blank page, or in the best case scenario, on a large text area prefilled with some text and comments, you can create an actual form like this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLzJp6FX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nuaivn3at0w0qnxjis5e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLzJp6FX--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nuaivn3at0w0qnxjis5e.png" alt="Form Template" width="800" height="849"></a></p>

<p>What can we see here? There are many types of fields, like text, dropdowns and checkboxes, and each of them can have a label and description.</p>

<p>Some fields are required while some are optional and there are also some text separators to group fields together.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  How to set up a form
</h3>

<p>Similarly to the markdown template I've talked about in the <a href="https://leonardomontini.dev/github-issue-markdown-template">previous article</a>, form templates are also stored in the <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder of your repository, but instead of creating a markdown file, you need to create a yaml file.</p>

<p>Before defining the form, you can set up some extra fields to define your template, that are, for example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Bug Report</span>
<span class="na">description</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Report a bug</span>
<span class="na">labels</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">bug'</span><span class="pi">]</span>
<span class="na">assignees</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">Balastrong'</span><span class="pi">]</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s1">'</span><span class="s">[BUG]</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">'</span>
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>This setup lets you define the name and description that will be shown in the template selection page, the labels and assignees that will be automatically added to the issue and the title that will be prefilled in the issue title field, which is usually a prefix like <code>[BUG]</code> or <code>[FEATURE]</code>.</p>

<p>Right after this block, on the same file, you can start defining the fields of the form inside the <code>body</code> key, like this:<br>
</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">body</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">markdown</span>
    <span class="na">attributes</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">value</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
        <span class="s">Please fill out the sections below to help everyone identify and fix the bug</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">textarea</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">description</span>
    <span class="na">attributes</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">label</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Describe your issue</span>
      <span class="na">placeholder</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">When I click here this happens</span>
    <span class="na">validations</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">required</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">checkboxes</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">checks</span>
    <span class="na">attributes</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">label</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Extra fields</span>
      <span class="na">options</span><span class="pi">:</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">label</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">I have used the search function to check if an issue already exists</span>
          <span class="na">required</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
        <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">label</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">I'd like to work on this issue</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">markdown</span>
    <span class="na">attributes</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">value</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
        <span class="s">Thanks for reporting this issue! We will get back to you as soon as possible.</span>
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>You can find the full reference in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema#keys">official docs</a>.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  External Links
</h2>

<p>Sometimes when a user is going to create an issue, you actually want them first to read some documentation or directly redirect them to a more appropriate place, for example a discord server or stackoverflow for asking questions.</p>

<p>The external links feature lets you do exactly that, by adding a list of links to the template.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VSH8VqiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m7y9k9twxsknys1ytl3d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VSH8VqiS--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m7y9k9twxsknys1ytl3d.png" alt="External links" width="756" height="373"></a></p>

<p>In this case, right below Bug Report and New Feature I linked Discord for generic questions and the CONTRIBUTING.md file on my repository where there's a specific section addressing the most common issue that is setting up the login on local development.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  How to set up external links
</h3>

<p>Not really a surprise (thanks for the consistency GitHub), external links are also stored in the <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder of your repository, this time in a specific file called <code>config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>The content to render what you can see in the image above is:<br>
</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight yaml"><code><span class="na">blank_issues_enabled</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
<span class="na">contact_links</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Questions</span>
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://discord.gg/5CceB5Y6Zt</span>
    <span class="na">about</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">You can join the discussions on Discord.</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Login does not work</span>
    <span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://github.com/Balastrong/github-stats/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md</span>
    <span class="na">about</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Before opening a new issue, please make sure to read CONTRIBUTING.md</span>
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>As you can see here, all links are an array under the <code>contact_links</code> key, and each link has a name, url and about field.</p>

<p>You can also notice that I set <code>blank_issues_enabled</code> to true, which means that the user can still create a blank issue, without using any template. This isn't a security block but only enables a text right below the templates block saying <em>"Don‚Äôt see your issue here? Open a blank issue."</em></p>

<p>In any case, nothing stops the user from creating a blank issue by manually going on <code>https://github.com/[Account]/[Repo]/issues/new</code> even if there are templates.</p>
