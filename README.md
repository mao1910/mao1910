 #### - [XSS Attack - Why strip_tags is not enough](https://dev.to/rodrigojavornik/xss-attack-why-striptags-is-not-enough-5gmo) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In PHP, it is common to use the <code>strip_tags()</code> function as a way to prevent XSS intrusion. However, this function does not even work to mitigate this type of attack, giving a false sense of security. But why?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What is XSS?
</h2>

<p>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a form of attack that occurs when an attacker exploits a vulnerability in a web application to insert malicious scripts into its pages. These scripts are executed in the browsers of the application's users and can compromise sensitive information, allow session theft, redirect to other sites, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Cb68CjW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/feo4fipn297d3w3yq0yj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---Cb68CjW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/feo4fipn297d3w3yq0yj.png" alt="how xss attack works" width="800" height="460"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why strip_tags don't work?
</h2>

<p>The <code>strip_tags()</code> function is commonly used to remove HTML and PHP tags from a string. However, it is not designed to handle all forms of malicious input that can lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. </p>

<p>Here are some reasons why <code>strip_tags()</code> falls short in mitigating XSS attacks:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Attribute-based attacks:</strong> XSS attacks can occur through attributes such as onmouseover or onclick, which can execute JavaScript code when triggered. <code>strip_tags()</code> does not remove or sanitize these attributes, allowing potential XSS vulnerabilities to remain.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tag obfuscation:</strong> Attackers can obfuscate the HTML tags and their attributes to bypass <code>strip_tags()</code>. They can use techniques such as mixing case variations, HTML entity encoding, or JavaScript-based obfuscation. <code>strip_tags()</code> alone cannot effectively handle these obfuscated tags.</li>
<li>
<strong>Context-awareness:</strong> XSS vulnerabilities can vary depending on the context in which the user input is displayed. <code>strip_tags()</code> does not have knowledge of the specific context and may allow certain tags or attributes that can still lead to XSS attacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>An example of malicious string that can be used in an XSS attack is as follows:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>this is a XSS attack &lt;script&gt;alert(“hello world”)&lt;script&gt;
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>If we apply the <code>strip_tags()</code> function, we obtain the following result:<br>
</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>this is a XSS attack alert(“hello world”)
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>Okay, in this case, it was indeed possible to clean the malicious code from the string. However, the attacker can use the following code:<br>
</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>this is a XSS attack &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; alert('oi') &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>The <code>strip_tags()</code> function will not sanitize the string in a way that prevents the injection of code into the page.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  How to prevent it?
</h2>

<p>The good way to deal with untrusted data is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Filter on input, escape on output</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that you handle the received data (filter), but only transform it (escape or encode) when you send it as output to another system that requires encoding.</p>

<p>There is no way around it. In the data sanitization phase, the only way to effectively prevent XSS attacks is by using a specific library, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/voku/anti-xss">AntiXSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/">HTML Purifier</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These libraries provide robust mechanisms for preventing XSS attacks by sanitizing and properly handling user input and output.</p>

<p>Here, we are going to use the AntiXSS library.<br>
Now we can sanitize our strings in a much safer way:<br>
</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="kn">use</span> <span class="nc">voku\helper\AntiXSS</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">require_once</span> <span class="k">__DIR__</span> <span class="mf">.</span> <span class="s1">'/vendor/autoload.php'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nv">$antiXss</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">AntiXSS</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nv">$xssString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"this is a XSS attack &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; alert('oi') &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nv">$clearString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$antiXss</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">xss_clean</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$xssString</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">//this is a XSS attack</span>
<span class="k">echo</span> <span class="nv">$clearString</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>In the phase of outputting data, you can use template engines like <a href="https://twig.symfony.com">Twig</a> or <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade">Blade</a> or <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php">htmlspecialchars</a> function.</p>

<p>Great! Now we have a good way to sanitize XSS.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that sanitization is just one of the steps in preventing XSS. But that is a topic for another text...</p>

 #### - [Tips for Acing Technical Interviews: Lessons from Both Sides of the Table](https://dev.to/pacheco/tips-for-acing-technical-interviews-lessons-from-both-sides-of-the-table-5262) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Preparing for a technical interview can be challenging, but there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of success. As someone who has conducted many technical interviews, I've learned some valuable lessons that I believe can help interviewees prepare for successful interviews. In this blog post, I'll be sharing three key tips for interviewees.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Preparation is Essential
</h2>

<p>Preparation is key when it comes to tech interviews. This includes researching the company, the role you're interviewing for, and the technologies you'll be working with. It's also important to practice your technical skills by working on projects, completing coding challenges, and reviewing common interview questions. Additionally, make sure to prepare questions to ask your interviewer. This not only shows your interest in the company and role, but also gives you the opportunity to learn more about the company culture, team dynamics, and potential growth opportunities.</p>

<p>To have even more chances of success when it comes to preparation, keep in mind that there are huge differences in interview formats depending on the size of the company you are applying to. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Differences in Interview Formats and Questions
</h2>

<p>It's important to note that the interview format and questions can vary widely depending on the size and type of company you're interviewing with. Startups, mid-size companies, and FANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) all have different approaches to interviewing.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Startups
</h3>

<p>Startups often have a more informal interview process and may focus more on cultural fit than technical skills. You may be asked to complete a coding challenge or technical task, but the interview may also include more casual conversations about your background, interests, and values. Startups may also be more likely to ask behavioral questions and assess your problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>Another important factor is that startups are usually more focused on specific skills, like a specific language or set of frameworks. In this case, if you are applying for a job on a startup it is recommended to check the stack they use and focus your studies on those topics.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Mid-Size Companies
</h3>

<p>Mid-size companies may have a more formal interview process, but still place a strong emphasis on cultural fit. They may also have a mix of technical and behavioral questions and may ask you to complete coding challenges or whiteboard exercises. Mid-size companies may also assess your ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively.</p>

<p>For the preparation steps, it is worth it to keep in mind that mid-size companies are somewhat similar to startups in that they may ask you questions more focused on a specific language or framework. On the other hand, they will also ask you algorithm-like questions so it is important to practice common algorithms.</p>

<p>Another important thing to keep in mind is that, as a growing company, they may also be facing challenges with scalability and possibly database performance, so it is interesting to review common database performance improvement techniques as well as scalability strategies.</p>

<p>Great resources to understand these topics are the books: <code>Designing Data-intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann</code> and <code>System Design Interview 1 and 2</code>  </p>

<h3>
  
  
  FANGs
</h3>

<p>FANGs often have a rigorous and structured interview process that heavily emphasizes technical skills. You can expect multiple rounds of interviews, including coding challenges, whiteboard exercises, and technical discussions with multiple interviewers. FANGs may also ask behavioral questions, but the focus is typically on assessing your technical abilities and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>In this case, you should focus most of your time on algorithm questions and solve the questions on <code>Leetcode</code> since they are very close to what is asked.</p>

<p>System design questions are also very heavy and it is recommended that you practice designing and presenting it. For this topic, I recommend resources like <a href="https://bytebytego.com/">ByteByteGo</a>.</p>

<p>The process on FANGs is very heavy, so if that is your goal I suggest you practice a lot and even find some friends to do some mock interviews together.</p>

<p>In summary, it's important to understand the differences in interview formats and questions between startups, mid-size companies, and FANGs. By researching the company and preparing accordingly, you can increase your chances of success in the interview process. Remember to focus on communication skills, preparation, and honesty, and approach the interview with confidence and a willingness to learn and grow.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Communication is Key
</h2>

<p>While technical skills are important, communication skills are just as crucial in tech interviews. Being able to articulate your ideas and communicate effectively with your interviewer can demonstrate your abilities and potential as a candidate. Even if you don't know the answer to a particular question, being able to explain your reasoning and thought process can show that you have a strong foundation of knowledge and are capable of learning quickly.</p>

<p>As most of the interviews nowadays are online, a quick tip I can give you is to write a script to facilitate remembering things. Even if it is related to your skills and experience, when we are under pressure it is very hard to articulate well while remembering things and considering the best answers.<br>
You are often going to be asked to talk about specific situations in your experience. It can be related to dealing with conflicts, deadlines, bad decisions and much more. Following the tip above, you could also keep a cheat sheet of the best personal stories of your experience. Further, I recommend you to follow the STAR (Situation, Task, Action and Result) method when answering these questions, it has been proven a very efficient method to express your experience and your hability to deal with certain situations.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Honesty is the Best Policy
</h3>

<p>It can be tempting to exaggerate your skills or experiences during a tech interview, especially if you feel like you're not fully qualified for the position. However, being dishonest or misleading during an interview can have serious consequences. If you're hired for a role that you're not fully qualified for, it can lead to frustration and disappointment for both you and the company. Additionally, if you're caught in a lie during the interview process, it can damage your reputation and potentially harm future job prospects. Instead of trying to fake your way through an interview, be honest about your skills and experiences, and focus on how you can learn and grow in the role.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>In conclusion, technical interviews can be challenging, but with the right preparation, communication skills, and honesty, you can increase your chances of success. Remember to research the company, understand the differences in interview formats, and practice your technical skills and communication skills. By following these tips, you'll be well on your way to acing your next tech interview.</p>

<p>This is the same approach to understanding the errors you find, just read the error messages a little more, and this is the case with a ton of other errors.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  2 What is this error saying?
</h1>

<p>Simply, that a particular screen is created twice in the navigation.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  3 Investigating
</h1>

<p>search through your root cause, for me, you've guessed it right, the <strong>BottomTabNavigation</strong> component.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
In today's digital age, it's essential for businesses to stay competitive, especially when it comes to pricing their products. One way to do this is by regularly comparing your product prices with those of your competitors. This blog post will explain the purpose of a Puppeteer script that automates the process of extracting book prices from a website and comparing them with prices from an API.</p>

<p><strong>Puppeteer and Axios:</strong><br>
Puppeteer is a headless browser automation tool that allows you to control and interact with web pages programmatically. Axios is a popular JavaScript library for making HTTP requests. Together, they provide a powerful toolset for web scraping and data extraction.</p>

<p><strong>Script Overview:</strong><br>
The provided Puppeteer script has several key objectives:</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>1.Launch a headless web browser using Puppeteer.
2.Navigate to a specific website that lists the top 100 books.
3.Iterate through multiple pages of book listings.
4.Extract the URLs of individual book product pages.
5.For each book product page, extract the price and SKU information for different book formats (e.g., Audiobook, eBook, Paperback, Hardcover).
6.Make API calls to a price comparison service to fetch the correct prices for the books.
7.Compare the web prices with the API prices to identify any discrepancies.
8.Store the results in a structured format (JSON file).
</code></pre>

</div>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
This Puppeteer and Axios script automates the process of comparing book prices between a website and an API, helping businesses make informed pricing decisions. It demonstrates the power of web scraping and data extraction with Puppeteer and the ease of making API requests with Axios. By regularly running such scripts, businesses can stay competitive and ensure their pricing remains competitive in the market.</p>

<p><a href="https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.0"><strong>Bun 1.0</strong></a></p>

<p>It's impossible to miss it this week: Bun has just been released as stable v1.0. This news isn't directly related to React, but it will undoubtedly affect all React developers out there at some point.</p>

<p>Bun is a complete toolchain for JavaScript and TypeScript based on Webkit and written in Zig. It is a new ultra-fast alternative to a whole host of front-end tools we use today: Node.js, npx, Babel, esbuild, swc, webpack, Jest, Vitest, npm, Yarn, pnpm... The benchmarks are super impressive and definitively real.</p>

<p>Its compatibility with the existing tools and its mixed ESM/CJS support make it quite easy to adopt as a drop-in replacement. Bun is generally able to run your code as is, without any changes (otherwise it's <a href="https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1700497869160268155">🐦 considered a bug</a>). React frameworks like Next.js, Remix and Astro are already supported. Using it as a replacement for npm/Yarn/pnpm or Jest/Vitest is probably a good entry point and not too risky.</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tmikov2023/static-hermes-react-native-eu-2023-announcement"><strong>Static Hermes</strong></a></p>

<p>Static Hermes was announced at React-Native EU last week. I wasn't there, so I'm trying to explain what I understood by reading the slides, as the video isn't on YouTube yet.</p>

<p>Static Hermes is an experimental project that allows you to optionally compile some of your TypeScript (or Flow) code into native code. This offers significant performance gains (x10-20) compared to Hermes usual mode based in bytecode interpretation. It also enables easy integration with native APIs directly from your TypeScript code (zero-cost FFI, x15-80 faster than a JSI wrapper).</p>

<p>To enable this, TypeScript must first become a "sound" language. Static Hermes will modify the semantics of JavaScript to ensure that the declared types matches the runtime types. This slide explains the concept well:</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tmikov2023/static-hermes-react-native-eu-2023-announcement?slide=14"><img src="/emails/issues/159/hermes2.jpg" alt="Static Hermes makes TypeScript sound"></a></p>

<p>A very interesting idea that could maybe one day have an impact outside the React-Native ecosystem?</p>
