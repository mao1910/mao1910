 #### - [I Built A SaaS Directory That Uses AI To Recommend Tools](https://dev.to/johnwritescode_/i-built-a-saas-directory-that-uses-ai-to-recommend-tools-14c7) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>So I've always wanted to randomly build a tool directory for some reason.</p>

<p>They're usually pretty light in terms of tech requirements, and it's something completely different compared to what I've done with past projects.</p>

<p>I was sick a few weeks ago and decided to use my downtime to work on one. </p>

<p>There are a lot of these types of directories out there, so I wanted to try and figure out how to make mine stand out a little more.</p>

<p><strong>What better way to do it than with AI? LOL</strong></p>

<p>A problem I've heard and noticed when it comes to these directories is that there's simply too much to sift through. I've come across the same problem myself.</p>

<p>So I decided to sprinkle in a little AI. Basically, you describe a problem you're having and we'll recommend some tools that we think could help in some way or another.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGp5cHZrbHdkcGc5OW1za3pkMDh4c2JnN3lpZDJjbm9lMG12bHR6aSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/aJZiluAHlVmz6hvZhQ/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbGp5cHZrbHdkcGc5OW1za3pkMDh4c2JnN3lpZDJjbm9lMG12bHR6aSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/aJZiluAHlVmz6hvZhQ/giphy.gif" alt="findcool.tools ToolFinder Ai" width="480" height="336"></a></p>

<p>The majority of tools are submitted by the community. They usually come from places like Twitter or Reddit. Then I manually review them to ensure everything looks good before pushing to the site, which is <a href="https://findcool.tools">findcool.tools</a></p>

<p>Even though this was just a fun random project I wanted to start, I decided to launch it on Product Hunt. Much to my surprise, we received #3 Product of the Day.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EOUcCne5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzjwitb7a4ro6dt2rzli.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EOUcCne5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kzjwitb7a4ro6dt2rzli.png" alt="findcool.tools product hunt award badge" width="428" height="111"></a></p>

<p>Since then, I've been putting a little more time into it. We're almost at 150 tools submitted and over 150 <a href="https://findcooltools.beehiiv.com/">newsletter</a> subscribers.</p>

<p><strong>Here's the tech stack I'm using for anyone interested:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Astro for the frontend</li>
<li>Google Sheets for my database</li>
<li>Google Forms for new tool submissions</li>
</ul>

<p>Told you I was keeping the tech stack light... haha</p>

<p>All in all, this is turning into a fun project and I just wanted to spread the word that if you have a random idea, pursue it. You never know what will come out of it.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this. You can find me over on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnwritescode_">Twitter/X</a></p>

<p>Have a tool you think would be a good fit for <a href="https://findcool.tools">findcool.tools?</a> You can <a href="https://findcool.tools/tools">submit it here</a>.</p>

 #### - [What is JavaScript(and what can you do with it)](https://dev.to/annoh_karlgusta/what-is-javascriptand-what-can-you-do-with-it-5fec) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  What is JavaScript
</h2>

<p>JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world right now. It is growing faster than any other programming language and big companies like Netflix, Walmart, and PayPal build entire applications around JavaScript. </p>

<p>And here is the average salary of a JavaScript developer in the United States. That is $72,000 per year according to glassdoor.com. </p>

<p>So, it is a great opportunity to get a good job out of learning JavaScript. You can work as a front-end developer, a back-end developer or a full stack developer who knows both the front end and the back end.</p>

<p>Now the second question.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What can you do with JavaScript
</h2>

<p>For a long time, JavaScript was only used in browsers to build interactive web pages. Some developers refer to JavaScript as a toy language. But those days are gone because of huge community support and investments by large companies like Facebook and Google.</p>

<p>This days, you can build full-blown web or mobile apps, as well as real time networking applications like chat and video streaming services, command-line tools, or even games. Here is an example:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jFQ6w57v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33565767/228169522-7f5a15ac-3606-474f-8a57-43b1c6c84988.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jFQ6w57v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33565767/228169522-7f5a15ac-3606-474f-8a57-43b1c6c84988.png" alt="A JavaScript game" title="A JavaScript game" width="800" height="426"></a></p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>You can get my members-only eBook! It's been called "the most practical and informative" Complete HTML, CSS and JavaScript eBook. But it's a well-kept secret. Because it's not sold in every bookstore. <strong>The Complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript eBook(Zero to Mastery)</strong> is packed with hands-on advice for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 #### - [What and Why to use HOCs in React](https://dev.to/xmohamedawad/what-and-why-to-use-hocs-in-react-1m8m) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h3>
  
  
  Higher-Order Components in React (HOC)
</h3>

<p>Imagine you're a magician and you have a magic box. You can put anything into this box, say a rabbit, and the box will add a hat to it. Now, every time you pull out a rabbit, it's wearing a hat! This is what Higher-Order Components (HOCs) do in React. They're like the magic box that adds extra features or behaviors to a component.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?
</h3>

<p>In React, a Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with added features or behaviors. It's a way of reusing component logic across multiple components without modifying their code. This makes them a flexible and reusable way to add functionality to your components.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  When and How to Use HOCs?
</h3>

<p>In the real world, as a developer, you often find yourself writing code that is repetitive or similar in nature. This is where Higher-Order Components (HOCs) come to the rescue in React. I recently used a HOC in my project, an "Arab van"(rental system), and it greatly simplified my code by abstracting out common logic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to fetch data in multiple components. Instead of repeating the fetching logic in each component, I created a Higher-Order Component (HOC) named withFetchData.</p>

<p>Every HOC name starts by <code>with</code> like <code>withFetchData</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This HOC takes a component (WrappedComponent) and a fetchData function as its arguments.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">withFetchData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">WrappedComponent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fetchData</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">memoizedFetchData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">useCallback</span><span class="p">(()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">fetchData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">]);</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">loading</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">execute</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">useAsync</span><span class="p">(</span>
      <span class="nx">memoizedFetchData</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="kc">false</span>
    <span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="nx">useEffect</span><span class="p">(()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">loading</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">execute</span><span class="p">();</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">]);</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">WrappedComponent</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="nx">vanId</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">}</span> 
           <span class="p">{...</span><span class="nx">props</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="sr">/&gt;</span><span class="err">;
</span>  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>And here's how you can use it:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">EnhancedComponent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">withFetchData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">MyComponent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fetchData</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><em>The result is a new component (EnhancedComponent) that behaves exactly like MyComponent, but with added data fetching capabilities.</em></p>




<h3>
  
  
  Why I Chose HOC
</h3>

<p>The reason I chose to use an HOC for this purpose was twofold:</p>

<p>Code Reusability: By encapsulating the data fetching logic inside a HOC, I was able to reuse this logic across multiple components, thereby reducing code duplication and making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.<br>
Separation of Concerns: The HOC allowed me to separate the data fetching logic from the presentation logic of my components. This made the components easier to understand, test, and maintain.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  In conclusion,
</h3>

<p>Higher-order components are a powerful tool in React that allows you to write cleaner, more reusable code. I found them to be incredibly useful in my "rental van app" project, and I believe they can be beneficial in many other scenarios as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, every line of code you write is a step towards becoming a better developer. Keep learning, keep growing, and most importantly, have fun along the way!</p>
</blockquote>




<p>As a React developer, I'm currently on the lookout for new opportunities. If you know of any roles where my experience could be a good fit, I would love to hear from you.</p>

 #### - [Zustand State Management](https://dev.to/cmphill/zustand-state-management-5gkd) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h4>
  
  
  Introduction
</h4>

<p>Have you ever been frustrated by endless prop drilling, but were intimidated by state management solutions like Redux? Not to worry--there is a lightweight, low syntax, unopinionated solution called Zustand. Zustand allows you to create a file, called a store, that saves as many states as you like all in one file and import them in the components that you need them in. One of the great advantages of this approach is that Zustand supports variables of both primitive data types and of functions and arrays. The variables need not be related to one another in any form; you can place them all in the same store without any particular order.  Furthermore, you can selectively import the variables that you need for a component instead of a wholesale import. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Getting started
</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do to is install Zustand for your repository by running<br>
<code>npm install zustand</code><br>
phew. Now that we have that out of the way, we'll begin the similarly strenuous process of creating the store. In a new file, (you can name this whatever you like, but store.js(x) is convention),</p>

<p>write <code>import {create} from 'zustand'</code>.<br>
Your store is created, and now you can define variables. </p>
<h3>
  
  
  Creating variables
</h3>

<p>There are several approaches to managing your store, including setting up a store and then adding on states and variables later. However, I found that having one large set with all the variables I needed worked just fine for a small project.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const useStore = create( set =&gt; ({
    users: [],
    addUser: (user) =&gt; set(state =&gt; ({users: 
    [...state.users, user]
    current_user: {},
    setCurrentUser: (state) =&gt; set({current_user: state}),
    logoutCurrentUser: () =&gt; set({current_user: 
    null}),
    items: [],
    addItems: (item) =&gt; set(state =&gt; ({items: [...state.items, item})),
    clearItems: () =&gt; set({items: []})
}))
 }))

export default useStore
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  Importing and Using Variables
</h3>

<p>Once you have your variables created, you can import them into the component(s) they are needed for. If you are only including one or two variables, you can import them using the following syntax:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>in your component:
//Example.jsx component
import useStore from "../store" //=&gt; This will be whatever the relative path to your store component is

function Example() {
   const current_user = useStore((state) =&gt; state.current_user)
const setCurrentUser = useStore((state) =&gt; state.setCurrentUser)

   function setUser() {
    fetch("/api/login")
    .then((res) =&gt; res.json())
    .then((user) =&gt; {
    setCurrentUser({
     id: user.id,
     username: user.username,
    })
  }
}


</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This simple implementation of store worked just fine for my small project. I used useEffect and the promise-based nature of fetches to manage asynchronous operations. However, Zustand is capable of handling async and it allows you to bundle variables together to re-render when the value of one changes. </p>

<p>One of the things you will want to do frequently once you have updated the state is to read it, of course. When you simply need the value of the state to render text in a DOM element, for example, you can assign it to a variable using the built in method on the store:<br>
<code>const user = useStore.getState.user</code>. In this way you can access the value without updating it whenever you need to.</p>

<p>For example, you could write a store in this fashion:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const marbleStore = create((set) =&gt; ({
    marbles: {},
    fetch: async(marbleBag) =&gt; {
    const response = await fetch(marbleBag)
    set({marbles: await response.json()})
}
}))
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>There are many such applications, including updating the re-rendering the component whenever one of the specified states from within the component changes. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Summary of Zustand Benefits
</h3>

<p>There are many advantages that make Zustand a great choice for a variety of projects. One is that it uses the logic of React hooks and (depending on how you use it, context). Doing so means that you don't have to write a lot of extra code to get started, and the library is quite small (less than 2kB, so it won't weigh down your repository). Because it is simple, it allows you to enter the world of state management without too much hassle. Another nice feature is the documentation. It provides many practical examples of the code in use as well as links to a sandbox where you can test out variations. Zustand automatically determines which which state a component needs and subscribes it, so no developer input is necessary in simple cases. Zustand also lets you persist data, meaning that when a user refreshes the page, the data the was previously rendered will still be saved in state. This is a great addition to forms and other pages geared toward user interaction so that progress is not lost. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h3>

<p>Zustand is a powerful library that is easy to get started with and offers a simple way to manage state across many components. You can manage async, set re-renders, persist the data, and subscribe to changes in other variables to fully customize your store's function. However, if you are simply looking for an easy, but more functional alternative to useState, you can use Zustand without a lot of extra bells and whistles.</p>
