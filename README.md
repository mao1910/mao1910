 #### - [What's Behind the Excitement in the JavaScript Community about Bun.js?](https://dev.to/mitchiemt11/whats-behind-the-excitement-in-the-javascript-community-about-bunjs-2p4l) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Howdy, folks!👋</p>

<p>Bun, a new JavaScript runtime that entered beta in July 2022, has generated significant buzz within the JavaScript community, v1.0 is out! Developers are enthusiastic about it for several reasons.</p>

<p><strong>What is Bun</strong><br>
Firstly, Bun is described as <strong>"a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime"</strong> and is developed by Jarred Sumner using the Zig programming language. It joins the ranks of Deno.js and Node.js, but what sets it apart is its focus on delivering exceptional speed and enhanced complexity.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKxCBq9y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g02ppepuapdvvp7x9osu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wKxCBq9y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g02ppepuapdvvp7x9osu.png" alt="Bun landing" width="800" height="369"></a></p>

<p>JavaScript has evolved significantly over the years, with features like ES modules and async/await that were not present when Node.js was initially created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. Dahl's own regrets about certain aspects of Node.js led to the development of Deno.js in 2020, built with Rust to address issues related to security, performance, and native TypeScript support. Despite Deno's advantages, it hasn't seen widespread adoption, partly due to the need for rewriting npm packages.</p>

<p>Bun, on the other hand, has sparked excitement for its high-speed performance and compatibility with Node.js, leading some to speculate that it could be a "Node-killer."</p>

<p><strong>How does Bun.js differ from Deno.js and Node.js?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FvU4vVMP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/75ugrnpogg9m0r05sbpy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FvU4vVMP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/75ugrnpogg9m0r05sbpy.gif" alt="thinking gif" width="370" height="300"></a></p>

<p>While Node.js, Deno.js, and Bun.js are all runtimes for JavaScript outside the browser, there are significant differences among them. Node.js is written in C++, Deno.js in Rust, and Bun.js in Zig. Bun.js leverages Zig's attributes, such as clear control flow and low-level memory control, to make it easier to write fast software.</p>

<p>In terms of performance, Bun.js stands out. It uses Webkit's JavaScriptCore engine, the same engine that powers Apple's Safari, for a "fast start," and benchmark results on its website show it consistently outperforming both Node.js and Deno.js by at least three times.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u3kXvFs8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kuwpilbslff67d7vddzt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u3kXvFs8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kuwpilbslff67d7vddzt.png" alt="bun stats" width="800" height="733"></a></p>

<p>Bun.js also supports TypeScript and simplifies the installation of packages from npm with its built-in npm manager, making it up to 20 times faster than Node.js. Additional features include an integrated SQLite3 client, web APIs like get and WebSocket, automatic loading of environment variables, and a built-in test runner.</p>

<p>Of the three runtimes, Bun.js excels in terms of performance, Deno.js is known for its security, and Node.js boasts the largest and most stable community.</p>

<p><strong>Will Bun.js actually make an impact on the ecosystem?</strong></p>

<p>The JavaScript ecosystem is indeed excited about Bun.js. The hype surrounding its release is significant, and JavaScript developers are eager to explore its exceptional speed and robust tooling for productivity. The Bun.js Discord server already has a thriving community of over 2000 members, indicating strong enthusiasm for this new technology.</p>

<p><strong>What's the future outlook for Bun.js, Node.js, and Deno.js</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript is here to stay, and Bun.js, Node.js, and Deno.js all have their roles in its future. Node.js, with its recent release of version 20, remains a staple in many businesses and startups, including giants like PayPal.</p>

<p>Deno.js is actively evolving and expanding, aiming to become a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for managing JavaScript runtime services.</p>

<p>While Bun.js shows promise, it's still in the early stages and has limited support, particularly on Windows where it requires Windows Subsystem for Linux to run. It's not yet suitable for production-ready software, and there's work to be done to mature it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Bun.js has stirred up excitement in the JavaScript community with its promise of high-speed performance and innovative features, offering a compelling alternative to Node.js and Deno.js. Its future impact on the ecosystem remains to be seen, but it's clear that JavaScript developers are eager to embrace this new technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sp89y2lo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tg0lf9lfm0tpqu6rtwz8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sp89y2lo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tg0lf9lfm0tpqu6rtwz8.png" alt="Passkey Login Page" width="800" height="253"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. Prerequisites
</h2>

<p>This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with React, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Let’s dive in! Moreover, you need to have Node and NPM installed on your machine.‍</p>

<h2>
  
  
  3. Repository structure
</h2>

<p>Let’s first discuss the structure of our project (<a href="https://github.com/corbado/example-passkeys-react">full GitHub repo</a>):</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>


<p>The rest of the files of this project can be ignored for the purpose of this tutorial.‍</p>

<h2>
  
  
  4. Set up the React project
</h2>

<p>In the following, we explain step-by-step what needs to be done to successfully set up the React project.</p>

<p>Let’s start out by initializing a new React project. In this tutorial, we’re using React version 18.2.0:</p>

<p><code>npx create-react-app react-example<br>
</code><br>
If you’re asked to proceed, click “Yes”. Then execute:</p>

<p><code>cd react-example<br>
</code><br>
If you run</p>

<p><code>npm start<br>
</code><br>
the sample skeleton application starts at <a href="http://localhost:3000:">http://localhost:3000:</a></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t08XUOFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6t7ebiahvmum8z1fl16.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--t08XUOFe--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/w6t7ebiahvmum8z1fl16.png" alt="React skeleton" width="800" height="368"></a></p>
<h2>
  
  
  5. Set up the Corbado web component for passkey authentication
</h2>
<h3>
  
  
  5.1 Set up your Corbado account and project
</h3>

<p>Visit the <a href="https://app.corbado.com/signin#register">Corbado developer panel</a> to sign up and create your account (you’ll see the passkey sign-up in action here!).</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F-ePE7yP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64tbxytwwbcdbh0u0l6m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F-ePE7yP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/64tbxytwwbcdbh0u0l6m.png" alt="Corbado developer panel" width="800" height="357"></a></p>

<p>In the appearing project wizard, select “Integration guide”. Then, select “Web app” as type of app and afterward select “No existing users” as we’re building a new app from scratch. Moreover, providing some details regarding your frontend and backend tech stack as well as the main goal you want to achieve with Corbado helps us to customize and smooth your developer experience.</p>

<p>Then, jump over to the <a href="https://app.corbado.com/app/getting-started/integration-guide">integration guide</a> that helps to set up all required settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B1hgdJ-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2meg9e2x0mljpz2mvsk2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B1hgdJ-r--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2meg9e2x0mljpz2mvsk2.png" alt="Integration guide" width="800" height="541"></a></p>

<p>In step 1, we need to define a new authorized origin, which is <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in the case of our React application (you can give it any name you want, e.g. “local”).</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kEGZkW8f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5mw2iylu0w847e7eub9f.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kEGZkW8f--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5mw2iylu0w847e7eub9f.png" alt="Add authorized origin" width="800" height="505"></a></p>

<p>In this example, the creation of an API secret is optional. You would need it if you want to request protected user data from the Corbado backend or use Corbado’s session management for protecting your own resources.</p>

<p>Next, we set the Application URL, Redirect URL and Relying Party ID to the following values (see explanation below):</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F2J2t-If--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wgx9y5hocpilg86i6fdw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--F2J2t-If--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wgx9y5hocpilg86i6fdw.png" alt="Application URL Redirect URL Relying Party ID" width="800" height="405"></a></p>

<p>Application URL: Provide the URL where you embedded the web component, here: <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a><br>
Redirect URL: Provide the URL your app should redirect to after successful authentication and which gets sent a short-term session cookie, here: <a href="http://localhost:3000/profile">http://localhost:3000/profile</a><br>
Relying Party ID: Provide the domain (no protocol, no port and no path) where passkeys should be bound to, here: localhost<br>
The last two steps in the integration guide (“Add Corbado session management and protect your routes” and “Start using passkeys”) will be covered below.‍</p>
<h3>
  
  
  5.2 Embed the web component in the frontend
</h3>

<p>Now, let’s jump back to the code we created from step 4.</p>

<p>Then, we need to install the web component:</p>

<p><code>npm i @corbado/webcomponent<br>
</code><br>
Next, we create a .env file where we put in the Corbado project ID:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>


<p>Then, we add a new file Home.js. This file contains the sign up / login web component. As HTML attribute “project-id”, we past the project ID from the developer panel into the .env file and read it from there.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can modify the styling (via CSS classes) and text / behavior (via the developer panel or via HTML attributes).‍</p>

<p>Moreover, we install the “react-router-dom” package.</p>

<p><code>npm i react-router-dom<br>
</code><br>
Then, we add routing to index.js:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>


<p>Restart your React web app (via npm start) and open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in the browser. You should see the following screen with the Corbado web component to sign up and log in:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JSIVHfOy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/paj5v0jkdj7y5cwk9im6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JSIVHfOy--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/paj5v0jkdj7y5cwk9im6.png" alt="Passkey Login Page" width="800" height="253"></a></p>

<p>‍</p>

<h3>
  
  
  5.3 Set up the profile page
</h3>

<p>After successful authentication, the Corbado web component redirects the user to the provided Redirect URL (<a href="https://localhost:3000/profile">https://localhost:3000/profile</a>). This page renders basic user information (user ID and email) and provides a button to logout. Create a Profile.js file and add the following code:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>


<p>Also adapt index.js to provide adequate routing:</p>


<div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
  
</div>


<p>This page has content that should only be visible to authenticated users. Therefore, we use Corbado session management in the code above.‍</p>

<h3>
  
  
  5.4 Start using passkeys
</h3>

<p>If everything is set up and installed, run the application with</p>

<p><code>npm start<br>
</code><br>
You should see the following screen:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8LPUgew--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6eovqgijbnt9wvu0gk68.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p8LPUgew--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6eovqgijbnt9wvu0gk68.png" alt="Passkey Login Page" width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>After successful sign up / login, you see the profile page:</p>

<p>![Passkey Profile Page(<a href="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0i6w7ztyqpqw0h5qia7.png">https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g0i6w7ztyqpqw0h5qia7.png</a>)</p>

<p>‍</p>

<h2>
  
  
  6. Conclusion
</h2>

<p>This tutorial showed how easy it is to add passwordless authentication with passkeys to a React app using Corbado. Besides the passkey-first authentication, Corbado provides simple session management, that we used for a retrieval of basic user data. If you want to read more about how you can leverage Corbado’s session management to retrieve backend data, please check out our documentation <a href="https://docs.corbado.com/sessions/overview">here </a>or if you want to add Corbado to your existing app with existing users, please see our documentation <a href="https://docs.corbado.com/products/corbado-connect">here</a>.</p>

 #### - [Mastering Test-Driven Development (TDD) with C# Examples](https://dev.to/bakatsiasgeorge/title-mastering-test-driven-development-tdd-with-c-examples-5fk4) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>In the dynamic realm of software development, the pursuit of impeccable code, devoid of pesky bugs, is the ultimate quest. Yet, this journey is fraught with challenges, particularly as projects grow in complexity. This is where Test-Driven Development (TDD) emerges as your stalwart companion. In this comprehensive article, we will delve into TDD, unravel its merits, explore how to wield it proficiently with C# (complete with authentic code illustrations), and importantly, navigate the intricacies of requirements and what precisely should be tested. We will scrutinize the facets of your software that warrant testing, with practical examples spanning functionality, data types, boundaries, UI, security, performance, integration, and more. Additionally, we will examine the role of Docker in facilitating an optimal testing environment setup.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The TDD Ballet
</h2>

<p>What exactly does TDD entail? Envision TDD as a choreographed dance, with you as the choreographer:</p>

<p>Step 1 Craft a Test: Picture building a calculator. Initially, you formulate a test case that articulates your code's intended behavior. It resembles composing the dance steps.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>[Test]
public void TestAddition()
{
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
    Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Step 2 Craft the Code: Subsequently, you script the code, ensuring it aligns with the aspirations of your test. This phase equates to instructing your dancers in the steps.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Step 3 Execute the Test: It's time to evaluate whether your code performs the dance flawlessly. Execute the tests and verify that they passed as expected.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ dotnet test

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Step 4 Refine: If the dance seems somewhat lacking in elegance, you can fine-tune it. Polish your code to make it sleeker, swifter, or more efficient. However, remember the golden rule: don't disrupt what's already working.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>public class Calculator
{
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        if (a &lt; 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Input must be non-negative", nameof(a));
        }
        return a + b;
    }
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Step 5 Repeat: Continuously iterate through these steps for each new segment of the dance you intend to teach.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why TDD Triumphs
</h2>

<p>TDD isn't just a dance; it's a dance-off where victory is guaranteed.</p>

<p>Improved code quality: TDD can unveil any missing specifications of the feature you are developing and help find bugs early in the development cycle.</p>

<p>Painless Maintenance: Your code becomes a breeze to maintain. Farewell to those late-night debugging expeditions.</p>

<p>Swift Troubleshooting: If something falters, your tests pinpoint the trouble spot. No more sifting through code like a detective in a labyrinth.</p>

<p>Regression Resilience: Armed with an array of tests, you can confidently introduce fresh moves without disarraying the old ones.</p>

<p>Living Documentation: Your tests materialize as a cheat sheet for your code. Everyone comprehends what to expect in the dance.</p>

<p>Team Harmony: TDD fosters cohesion among your team, developers and testers.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Warrants Testing in TDD
</h2>

<p>Now, let's now address the most basic question: What should be subjected to testing in TDD? Here is a thorough analysis of your software's components that demand close examination, along with real-world examples:</p>

<p>Functionality Testing: This represents the very essence of TDD. You assess whether your code executes its designated functions. For instance, if you consider designing a calculator you should test against the addition function.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Functionality Testing - Calculator's Addition
[Test]
public void TestAddition()
{
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    int result = calculator.Add(2, 3);
    Assert.AreEqual(5, result);
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Data Type Testing: Validating data types for accuracy is essential. Ensure that the variables, inputs, and outputs you use correspond to the appropriate data type and size. This strategy works as a prevention towards data-related errors.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Data Type Testing - Verification of Integer Data Type
[Test]
public void TestIntegerDataType()
{
    int number = 42;
    Assert.IsInstanceOfType(number, typeof(int));
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Edge Cases and Boundaries: Probe the extremities. Investigate the outcomes when you present the smallest or largest conceivable values. For instance, if your calculator can process integers, examine its behavior with the most minuscule and colossal integers.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Edge Cases and Boundaries - Adding one to int.MaxValue should throw an OverflowException
[Test]
public void AddingOneToIntMaxValueThrowsOverflowException()
{
    int maxValue = int.MaxValue;

    Assert.Throws&lt;OverflowException&gt;(() =&gt;
    {
        int result = checked(maxValue + 1);
    });
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>UI Testing with Gherkin and SpecFlow: UI testing assumes paramount importance for assuring the seamless functionality of your application's user interface. Tools such as Gherkin and SpecFlow provide a framework to draft human-readable scenarios.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Scenario: Successful User Login
    Given the user navigates to the login page
    When they input valid credentials
    And click the login button
    Then they should be directed to the dashboard

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Security Testing: Security should never be an afterthought. Investigate vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. Specialized security testing frameworks can ferret out and mitigate these risks.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Security Testing - Prevention of SQL Injection
[Test]
public void TestSQLInjectionPrevention()
{
    // Simulate a SQL injection attempt
    string userInput = "'; DROP TABLE Users; --";
    bool isSafe = SecurityHelper.IsInputSafe(userInput);
    Assert.IsTrue(isSafe);
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Performance and Benchmark Testing: Evaluation of your software's performance is crucial as it grows. How quickly is it able to work? Can it handle an abundance of users or data? Tools for performance testing shed light on these questions.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Performance and Benchmark Testing - Evaluation of Response Time
[Benchmark]
public void MeasureResponseTime()
{
    PerformanceTester tester = new PerformanceTester();
    double responseTime = tester.MeasureResponseTime();
    Assert.IsTrue(responseTime &lt; 100); // Response time should be under 100 milliseconds
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Integration Testing: Examine the interactions between the various parts of your software. This is especially important for complex systems with several interrelated components.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>// Illustration: Integration Testing - API Integration Assessment
public void TestApiIntegration()
{
    ApiClient apiClient = new ApiClient();
    ApiResponse response = apiClient.Get("https://someApi.aa/Getdata");
    Assert.AreEqual(200, response.StatusCode);
}

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Regression Testing: As you introduce novel features or rectify defects, it's imperative to ascertain that the existing functionality remains unaffected. Execute regression tests to apprehend unintended side effects.</p>
