 #### - [Beyond Review Comments: Building a Friendlier Code Review Process with Code Reactions](https://dev.to/adadot/beyond-review-comments-building-a-friendlier-code-review-process-with-code-reactions-4job) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><a href="">Code Reactions</a> 🚀💩<br>
We welcome all ideas and contributions on <a href="">GitHub</a> 💚!</p>

<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adadot.code-reactions" class="ltag_cta ltag_cta--branded">Install extension →</a>
</p>




<p>
  <strong>TL;DR</strong>
  <br>

<pre><code>We created a vscode extension to add emoji reactions, even 

with comments, to any line of code of any Git repo! React and 

see others reactions to any piece of code straight from your

IDE, and have them follow (or not 😉) the code through 
changes.
</code></pre>




</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The story behind
</h2>

<p>After almost a decade of writing code in all sorts of environments, in a small startup or in a big enterprise with thousands of developers, we always felt <code>that there were some things that should be alongside our code, but never could be</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Giving and receiving feedback for your code</strong>. As developers we <em>learn from others</em>, and their reaction to our code either that being a 👍, 👎 or sometimes even a 💩 or a 🚀, is invaluable to our progress. Unfortunately, apart from reviews we don't really get the chance to tell someone what we think about their code.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Putting a mark or a note in the code</strong>. You are going about your task and suddenly you notice a piece of code that has that <code>smell</code>, or just <code>doesn't look right</code>, or is <code>outdated</code>, or uses an <code>old syntax</code>, or looks like it could even be <code>an issue</code>. Now your choices are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the task you are doing and fix it </li>
<li>Create an issue somewhere to come back to it at another time (or forever forget)</li>
<li>Do it with your task (<em>ouch!</em>)</li>
<li>Leaving a comment in the code and puzzling yourself a few months down the line, when the code has moved/changed, with the quiz <em>"what was I referring to here"</em>.</li>
</ol>


</li>
<li><p>Code quality metrics are very cool <em>as a concept</em>! However once used we all know that they feel a bit neither here nor there. Eg is a code bad if it has high complexity? Maybe, maybe not! I'd like to <strong>know what my collaborators thinks of the code</strong>, which parts are for a 😍 and which for a 🤔 and which repos and files are the ones that might need a look into cause 💩 has started pilling on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's why we wanted to make something that's:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open Source 💚 (share the love!)</li>
<li>It works in the <strong>IDE</strong>
</li>
<li>You can add <strong>emojis</strong> and <strong>comments</strong> 🚀</li>
<li>You can see others <strong>emojis</strong> and <strong>comments</strong> 👀</li>
<li>
<strong>Follows (or leaves) the code</strong> as it changes </li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  What we built
</h2>

<p>We built an IDE extension (vscode only for the time being,<br>
Intellij is in the works) that allows you to add emoji <br>
reactions, even with comments, to any line of code of any Git<br>
repo! </p>

<p>You can react and see others reactions to any piece of code straight from your IDE! </p>

<p>And <code>Reactions follow the code!</code>, meaning that it stays there for as long as the relevant line has not changed - <em>whitespace doesn't count as change</em> - and they get removed from the line when it's changed.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>first version</strong>, so it supports limited amount of emojis for now, and it has only a few features. We are super excited to have the community shape the tool and decide on the new features by contributing on GitHub</p>

 #### - [Don’t compare and compete with others, instead collaborate](https://dev.to/gregorojstersek/dont-compare-and-compete-with-others-instead-collaborate-b8j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>If you are a person who likes to compare and compete with your colleagues. Let me tell you one important thing. Don't compare or compete, instead help and collaborate.</p>

<p>Being a lone wolf and just focusing on yourself and your progress will certainly get you somewhere. But rather than trying to do everything yourself. You have a group of like-minded people who are all on the same path as you!</p>

<p>Your progression is going to be much:</p>

<ul>
<li>faster,</li>
<li>more exciting,</li>
<li>more fulfilling.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compete only with yourself and try to get better every day!</p>

<p>The software development world is smaller than you think. Collaborating and helping each other instead of competing puts you in a position where fellow like-minded people can help you find opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>A practical example</strong></p>

<p>If you are searching for a new role, the best way to find it is to get recommended for the position.</p>

<p>If someone from my team recommends a candidate.</p>

<p>I already know 2 things:</p>

<p>He/she already is familiar to an extent with a person on my team, so the collaboration and onboarding would be easier.</p>

<p>He/she has already shown to some extent capability to be able to do the job.</p>

<p>This gives you much better chances right from the start. Make sure to help each other to grow and progress in careers!</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

 #### - [Microservices: Unleashing the Power of Modular Software Architecture](https://dev.to/documatic/microservices-unleashing-the-power-of-modular-software-architecture-23h6) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h1>
  
  
  Introduction
</h1>

<p>We are in a generation where technology is evolving every day and it impacts the user expectation. It also leads to change in the way we design, build, and deploy any software application. We are currently moving towards the microservices architecture when comes to building applications. It is a driving force in modern software development.</p>

<p>Today monolithic applications are fewer in number as they try to encompass every feature, module, and component under a single codebase. As it hider the modern software development requirements and agility to keep up the pace with the evolving technology. The challenges are also related to the scalability of the software as you can not make changes to specific components independently. That’s why the Microservice architecture is gaining more popularity.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn more about the landscape of microservice architecture. We are going to look into the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is Microservices architecture?</li>
<li>Benefits of Using Microservices</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let’s get started.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  What is Microservice Architecture?
</h1>

<p>It is an approach to designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. In this, every service can perform different functionality. Each service can be designed, built, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. </p>

<p>The below diagram shows you the working architecture of microservices.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33cTLT4g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt2wekbvm28gpwcdudrw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33cTLT4g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt2wekbvm28gpwcdudrw.png" alt="Architecture of Microservie" width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram, the communication between each component is done with API. </p>

<p>There are many major tech giants that use microservices to build their applications. Here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon</strong>: They use microservices to build their services including Amazon Marketplace, Prime, and Web Services. This helps them rapidly innovate and make changes as per requirements faster.</li>
<li>
<strong>Netflix</strong>: It uses microservices in aspects such as streaming services, such as user recommendations, video streaming, billing, and content management.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paypal</strong>: It adopts microservices to enhance its payment processing, fraud detection, and user management systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>LinkedIn</strong>: It uses microservers to handle user connections, profile management, content delivery, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spotify</strong>: A major audio streaming site uses microservices to deliver personalized music recommendations, playlist management, and seamless playback across devices.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  Key principle of Microservices
</h1>

<p>Let’s learn about some of the key principles of microservices architecture. It is essential to understand those principles for perfect implementation. There are various principles among them some are:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
</h3>

<p>Since microservices emphasize modularity, the Single Responsibility Principle is used to define each service as having a single, well-defined functionality. It helps promote modular design and maintains clear boundaries between services.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Decentralized Data Management
</h3>

<p>Each service manages its own data store. It prevents tight coupling between services. Services can have their own database or it can be shared across different databases. It is not strictly defined to use a separate database for each service. As each service manages each data store, it allows data autonomy and reduces the risk of data inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  API First Design
</h3>

<p>As the API is the core for the communication between each component in this architecture, it is believed to be designed first. Microservices emphasize the importance of developing the API first. It helps in clear communication between each component. It also helps in compatibility.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Scalability
</h3>

<p>Scalability simply means the capacity of the system to handle increased workload, traffic, or data without a bottleneck in the performance. Microservices enable horizontal scaling. In horizontal Scaling, we add more machines and serve to distribute the load. Thus providing each service to be scaled independently based on demand. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Design for Failure
</h3>

<p>This architecture preassumes that failure will occur in the system at some point. Thus it is designed to handle failure. Services can degrade without impacting the entire system.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Benefits of Using Microservices
</h1>

<p>There are various benefits that you can get by using the microservice architecture. Here are some of them:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Modularity and Scalability
</h3>

<p>By using microservice architecture, you will be breaking down complex codebases into smaller and manageable components. Thus each component can be handled separately with its Software development life cycle. It allows scalability as you don’t need to make changes to the entire codebase when making changes to one component. Each component can be built, designed, deployed, and scaled separately.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Rapid Development
</h3>

<p>As each component can be built and deployed separately, we can run tests separately too. This will make the development cycles faster. It also becomes faster to provide updates to the application as you will need to make a few changes.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Technology Heterogeneity
</h3>

<p>Mircorservice allows you to build each component separately which means you can use different programming languages, frameworks, and stacks for different services. You can use the most efficient language and tool for that particular service. Otherwise, you can have to stick to that framework and language for the whole codebase.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Team Autonomy
</h3>

<p>Due to different features being shipped through different services, you can divide the team to work on that particular service. It will give autonomy to the team and you can develop applications in parallel. This will result in faster iteration and more efficient collaboration between teams. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Agility and Adaptability
</h3>

<p>Using microservices architecture, we can develop our application to be more agile. Meaning that it becomes easy to make changes to the application as per the client/user requirement changes. </p>

<h1>
  
  
  Limitation of Microservices
</h1>

<p>Everything comes with pros and cons. Microservices are no exception. Let’s look into some of them:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Complexity of Distributed Systems
</h3>

<p>Since there are separate services for each functionality, it can be very complex to manage each service. This can cause problems such as inter-service communication, data inconsistency, and fault tolerance.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Increase Operational Overhead
</h3>

<p>Building, deploying, and managing different services required sophisticated management tools. As there will be a number of services, it will increase the management cost. It can eventually lead to an increase in the operational cost of the whole project. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Data Management Challenges
</h3>

<p>As there will be a database connecting to each service, it can increase the complexity of managing the database. Maintaining data integrity in a distributed environment requires careful design and implementation.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Communication Challenges
</h3>

<p>Communication between each service and database is a crucial part of the microservices. They are communicated over a network. It can cause overload in the network and eventually cause network latency. Also, as the API is the key for the communication, it should be secured. It can ensure data privacy across services.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h1>

<p>The ever-evolving technologies have led to monolithic architecture being inadequate with the invocations. It has limitations such as scalability, agility, and flexibility. Due to this, microservices architecture is gaining popularity. It can provide a better option when comes to scalability.</p>

<p>As we have seen in the article, microservices architecture can improve the application by providing modularity, agility, and rapid development. It can help large applications to be better at handling each service. However, both microservices and monolithic will exist as there are also some limitations such as communication and complexity challenges in microservices.</p>

<p>I hope this article has helped you in learning the microservices architecture. Thanks for reading the article.</p>

<p>How to Check Competitor Backlinks: A Step-by-Step Guide<br>
Regular backlink audits can help you understand the amount and quality of backlinks currently on your website. </p>

<p>This knowledge can improve your SEO and visibility in search engine rankings. Having solid and authoritative backlinks from top-level domains is crucial for the success of any SEO strategy. </p>

<p>If you neglect this essential step, your rankings will suffer, and your website will not perform well in search results. To ensure the success of your analysis, here are some features you should look out for:</p>

<p>Identify your top competitors- The Organic Research Competitors report provides a complete list of established companies and new entrants. To measure how competitive one domain is compared to another, there is a parameter called the Competition level. </p>

<p>This enables you to get an idea of how much competition exists between the two domains. The competition level between you and your rivals is determined by two glaring factors - the number of ranked key phrases they possess and how many overlap yours.</p>

<p>Choose a backlink analysis tool- various backlink analysis tools exist in the market. However, depending on the type of business, choosing the one that suits your requirements is necessary. </p>

<p>Please do thorough market research on some of the best backlink analysis tools we have provided above and select the one you need.</p>

<p>Analyze competitors' backlink profiles- Now that you better understand your backlink situation, it's time to start looking for areas to improve. A great place to start is by assessing the most successful pages and identifying how to replicate their success.</p>

<p>Identify the types of content that generate the most links from high-value sources to create additional content of this kind. Keep your eyes peeled for chances to create content other websites might link to. You can contact them so they know your linkable assets and link back to you. </p>

<p>Regarding do-follow and no-follow links, knowing the exact amount of each is essential. Do-follow links are beneficial for your backlink profile as they pass on link juice, while no-follow links don't do that.</p>

<p>Find content gaps and link- Conducting a content gap analysis is an essential strategy if you want to improve the content of your website. You can make sure that your website performs better than the competition and precisely matches with your business objectives by carefully evaluating and optimizing the material that is already there. By using an analytical approach, you can spot holes in your present content strategy and deliberately plug them for the most impact. </p>

<p>For instance, consider the case of an SEO agency that has a large number of blog posts on cutting-edge SEO strategies. However, you see that users are leaving your pages far too frequently and hastily. A short study of the content gaps may help to clarify the issue by analyzing how interesting your content is.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, you must locate and fill any content gaps immediately. The Backlink Gap tool and the Overview report in the Backlink Analytics tool are two practical options for analyzing your backlink profiles. They allow you to measure the performance of 5 different domains simultaneously. </p>

<p>Broken links are hyperlinks that no longer connect to their intended destination. They can occur when a website or webpage is moved, deleted, or its URL is changed. Fixing broken links is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and ensuring that visitors can access the content they are seeking on a website. With the best backlink analysis tools, broken links, and content gaps can be located and fixed.</p>

<p>Monitor competitors' backlink activities over time- Although not required, we strongly urge you to conduct a competition study because it might show potential gaps in the content market. This will provide you with details about the following:</p>

<p>Any organization must understand where the majority of its backlinks come from.</p>

<p>Their content might create the most significant number of backlinks.</p>

 #### - [How is it to build something in public?](https://dev.to/azasypkin/how-is-it-to-build-something-in-public-3m3j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <blockquote>
<p>The original post was published on my blog on <strong>July 20, 2023</strong>, long before I realized it might be interesting to the dev.to community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It’s a hard, but rewarding experience!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>It’s been two months since I opened up <a href="https://secutils.dev/"><strong>Secutils.dev</strong></a> for an open beta and started writing about my indie hacking journey in public for the first time while still being a full-time employee at Elastic. In this short post, I just want to reflect on how things are going, what was good, and what wasn’t as good as I wanted it to be. If you’re in a similar situation or just curious, read on!</p>

<p>First of all, here are some stats from the last two months:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>102</strong> commits with fixes, enhancements, documentation, and features <a href="https://github.com/secutils-dev"><strong>across all Secutils.dev GitHub repositories</strong></a> </li>
<li>
<strong>18</strong> <a href="https://secutils.dev/docs/blog/"><strong>blog posts</strong></a> and the same amount of accompanying LinkedIn posts, <a href="https://twitter.com/aleh_zasypkin"><strong>tweets</strong></a>, and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@azasypkin"><strong>Mastodon posts</strong></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>3</strong> one-on-one user interviews conducted (too few, I know I know, but hey, I’m still learning)</li>
<li>
<strong>1</strong> big feature delivered (<a href="https://github.com/secutils-dev/secutils/issues/14"><strong>Resource Tracker</strong></a>, going to cut a new release next week)</li>
</ul>

<p>I admit that the stats don’t look super impressive, but I really enjoyed the ride so far! It’s hard to describe the satisfaction I get from talking to the users of something I’ve built from scratch and control every bit and piece of it – one of the most rewarding experiences in my whole 15-year career, for sure.</p>

<p>As you can see from the stats, old habits die hard – engineering still takes most of my time, and I didn’t spend enough time promoting Secutils.dev among the relevant communities and interacting with current and potential users. That’s something I’m going to fix.</p>

<p>The most important lesson I’ve learned during these two months? It’s hard to find enough time and energy for a side-project like Secutils.dev while having a relatively intense full-time job, and <a href="https://secutils.dev/docs/blog/time-management"><strong>very aggressive prioritization and subtraction</strong></a> isn’t just an option, it’s a necessity. Nobody said it was going to be easy, though. On the bright side, life isn’t discrete – everything I learn while pushing Secutils.dev forward perfectly applies to my full-time job, benefiting Elastic and my career, and vice versa, of course. Having a serious side gig like that, in my opinion, is one of the most effective ways to grow not only professionally but also as a resilient person.</p>

<p>That wraps up today's post, thanks for taking the time to read it!</p>
