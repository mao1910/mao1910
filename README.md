 #### - [I Created a Chrome Extension in 15 Minutes with Zero Front-End Knowledge Using GPT](https://dev.to/justlorain/i-created-a-chrome-extension-in-15-minutes-with-zero-front-end-knowledge-using-gpt-33df) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Preface
</h2>

<p>When reading, authors often mention various projects or related materials, and sometimes it's just plain text without corresponding links. If I want to learn more about these projects, I have to search for them myself, either through Google or other means. One common thing I often do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the name of a project.</li>
<li>Open a new tab.</li>
<li>Visit GitHub.</li>
<li>Paste and search.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps because I've been repeating this process too frequently recently, I came up with the idea to develop a plugin to simplify this process.</p>

<p>So, a few minutes later, I created my first Chrome extension, <a href="https://github.com/justlorain/ghs">GitHub Searcher (GHS)</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Expected Outcome
</h2>

<p>The desired outcome for the plugin is very simple, or one could say rudimentary: <strong>search for the text I've selected on GitHub, and be able to choose whether to search in the current tab or open a new tab</strong>. With this feature, I can simplify the four steps mentioned earlier into just two:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the content I want to search for.</li>
<li>Right-click and choose whether to search in the current tab or open a new tab.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Development Approach
</h2>

<p>After trying to search for several repositories on GitHub, I found that the URL for searching repositories on GitHub is:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight html"><code>github.com/search?q=test<span class="err">&amp;</span>type=repositories
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this URL, the <code>q</code> parameter corresponds to the search query content, and the default <code>type</code> is <code>repositories</code>. Therefore, to achieve the desired outcome, it becomes very simple. I just need to find a way to get the selected text, then concatenate it and visit the URL.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Development Process
</h2>

<p>With the basic idea in mind, it's time to start development. Since I primarily use Chrome, I decided to implement it as a Chrome extension.</p>

<p>I quickly went through the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/">Development basics</a> provided by the official Chrome documentation to understand the project structure and necessary files for a Chrome extension. However, my knowledge of front-end development is limited to a few common HTML tags. This is where I relied on my trusty friend GPT.</p>

<p>I organized my earlier thoughts into language that GPT could understand and fed them to it, and then... GPT generated all the code for me.</p>

<p>Initially, I didn't have very high expectations. I thought it would generate some code samples using Chrome API, which I could then modify to make it work. But when I copied the code generated by GPT into my project and loaded the extension in Chrome, the desired functionality was fully implemented!</p>

<p>My prompts to GPT were quite simple, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What's the operation called when you select a portion of text in a web page by pressing and dragging the mouse?</p>

<p><strong>GPT:</strong> In a web browser, the operation of selecting a portion of text by pressing and dragging the left mouse button is typically referred to as "text selection" or "text dragging." This operation allows users to highlight text on a web page for purposes such as copying, cutting, or performing other actions like searching or translating. It's a common interaction when reading web pages, copying information, or quoting text.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> What's the operation called when you right-click with the mouse in a web browser to open a menu?</p>

<p><strong>GPT:</strong> In a web browser, the operation of opening a menu by right-clicking with the mouse is usually called "context menu" operation, sometimes referred to as the "right-click menu." This menu typically contains options related to the element or area you right-clicked on, allowing you to perform various actions like opening links, saving images, copying text, and more. The content of this context menu can vary depending on what you right-clicked and your browser's settings. It provides a convenient way to access common functions quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> In some Chrome extensions, the right-click menu often has a submenu, such as "Image Helper," which contains various supported actions like "Extract Images from this page" and "Download Images from this page." Is there an official term for these?</p>

<p><strong>GPT:</strong> In Chrome extensions, these submenus within the right-click menu, which contain multiple related actions, are typically referred to as "context menu submenus" or "right-click submenus." These submenus allow extension developers to organize different functionalities supported by the extension into a larger group of options, providing more functionality choices and an improved user experience. In this submenu, each option usually represents a specific operation or feature supported by the extension. In the example you mentioned, the "Image Helper" submenu includes actions like "Extract Images from this page" and "Download Images from this page."</p>

<p>It's important to note that there isn't an official standard term for this, and different extension developers may use different terminology to describe this functionality. However, in general, the purpose of such submenus is to organize and present multiple related action options.</p>

<p><strong>Me:</strong> I want to develop a Chrome extension called "ghs" (GitHub Searcher). The usage of this extension is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The user selects some words or sentences on a web page using the mouse, which is the "text selection" operation.</li>
<li>The user right-clicks with the mouse to open a context menu and selects a submenu named "GitHub Searcher." This submenu contains two options: "Current Tab" and "New Tab."</li>
<li>After selecting text, clicking on these two options will open the URL <code>github.com/search?q={{ sample }}&amp;type=repositories</code> in either the current tab or a new tab, where <code>{{ }}</code> represents the selected text.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an actual use case: While browsing a web page, I select the word "helloworld," then right-click and choose the "New Tab" option from the "GitHub Searcher" submenu. The browser should then open a new tab and visit the URL <code>github.com/search?q=helloworld&amp;type=repositories</code>.</p>

<p>Now, I need your help to develop this extension. Please list each step and add necessary comments to the code to help me understand it.</p>

<p><strong>GPT:</strong> Developing a Chrome browser extension involves several steps. I'll list each step and add comments to the code to help you understand it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create the Extension Directory and Manifest File</strong></p>

<p>First, you need to create a local directory for your extension and create a manifest file (<code>manifest.json</code>) within that directory. The manifest file is used to define the extension's basic information, permissions, and functionality.</p>


<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="err">//</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">manifest.json</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre>


<p><strong>Step 2: Create the Extension Icon</strong></p>

<p>Add the extension icon (<code>icon.png</code>) to the extension directory. This icon represents your extension.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Create the Context Menu</strong></p>

<p>In the <code>background.js</code> file, create the context menu so that users can right-click selected text to open the extension's submenu. Here's an example <code>background.js</code> file:</p>


<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// background.js</span>

  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>


<p><strong>Step 4: Create the Extension Popup Page</strong></p>

<p>Create a popup page (<code>popup.html</code>) that will display information or settings when the user clicks the extension icon. You can customize this page as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Load the Extension</strong></p>

<p>Finally, load your extension in the Chrome browser:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Chrome browser and go to the extensions management page (chrome://extensions/).</li>
<li>Enable "Developer mode."</li>
<li>Click the "Load unpacked" button and select your extension directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you've completed these steps, your extension should be able to display the "GitHub Searcher" submenu when the user selects text and right-clicks, and it should open the corresponding GitHub search page when "Current Tab" or "New Tab" is selected.</p>

<p>Please note that this is a basic example, and you can further expand and customize the extension's interface according to your needs. Also, ensure that you follow the Chrome Web Store's publishing guidelines and best practices. Once successfully published, users can install and use your extension from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can see that the first three steps were primarily about aligning terminology and concepts with GPT. Only in the fourth step did I start combining these terms and my own ideas to have GPT generate the actual code.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the code provided by GPT was essentially correct and achieved the desired functionality when installed, but there were some flaws that needed to be addressed, such as the absence of <code>popup.html</code> and a reminder to set the icon. However, these were minor issues, and after designing a nice-looking icon and adding supplementary files like <code>popup.html</code> (optional), README, LICENSE, etc., our extension was complete :)</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>The above is the complete process of developing a Chrome extension from scratch with the help of GPT. A significant reason for the smooth development was that the functionality of this extension was quite simple, hhhh, but it certainly saved me some time.</p>

<p>Due to the complexity of publishing extensions in the Chrome Web Store, I didn't go through that process. If you're interested in this extension, you can download the source code and manually load it into your Chrome browser. Of course, if you find this extension useful, feel free to give the project a Star!</p>

 #### - [I Hired an AI as a Developer - This Is What Happened](https://dev.to/perssondennis/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened-1nl6) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>There have been many discussions around whether AI is threatening developer's jobs. Some say they are very close to take our jobs, other claims it will not happen, with the motivation that AIs will only be used as a tool for developers.</p>

<p>Whatever is true, I have tested an AI to see how easy an AI can pass a hiring process and how it well it can perform developing a product after meeting with a customer.</p>

<p>The AI I used for this, is our most well-known ChatGPT. Even though there are AIs out there more focused on code generation, I chose to use ChatGPT since it can be used in multiple steps in the development process from an idea to the deployment of a service.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, I have prompted ChatGPT to act according to the situation I have put it in. For example, the very first prompt I gave it was to let it know it was a developer knowing web techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this chat, pretend you are a web developer who knows HTML, CSS and React.</p>
</blockquote>

</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Interview
</h2>

<p>If AI should ever be able to take your job, it has of course to pass the job interview. Here's how the AI did on its first interview.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; You have applied for a job at a company with a couple of hundred employees. Now we will have your job interview where I am the interviewer.

&gt; First question: As an AI web developer, what can you contribute with at our company?

I can contribute expertise in React development to create robust and efficient web applications, enhancing user experiences and helping your team deliver high-quality projects.

&gt; Apart from your technical skills, what else are you good at?

In addition to my technical skills in React and web development, I am skilled in problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. I'm also adept at project management and have a strong commitment to continuous learning and staying updated with industry trends.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>A pretty normal start, isn't it?</p>

<p>Even a question about how to handle a sudden production problem gives a good (and formal) by-the-book answer.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; How would you handle the situation when we have a production problem with an old software?

I would start by analyzing the issue, identifying the root cause, and then working collaboratively with the team to implement a solution while minimizing downtime and user impact.

&gt; How would you do that in practice? How do you minimize user impact?

In practice, I would follow these steps to minimize user impact during a production problem:

1. Immediate Analysis
2. Isolate the Problem
3. Rollback if Possible
4. Temporary Fixes
5. Communication
6. Testing in Isolation
7. Gradual Deployment
8. Monitoring
9. Post-Mortem

By following these steps, we can minimize user impact and maintain a smooth user experience while resolving production problems.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>ChatGPT is a talkative bot, sometimes a bit too verbose, so I have shortened its answer slightly. In the full response, it did explain each numbered item quite thoroughly, but my attention as an interviewer isn't that good anyway.</p>

<p>With all tips and tricks out there on the internet and with these few quick screening questions I felt sure that the AI developer was promising enough to pass on to the next step in the hiring process.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  Code Tests
</h2>

<p>Now it's getting a bit more interesting. We have all learned that ChatGPT can be a very helpful co-programmer, but can it pass code tests on their own? Let's check that with three HTML and CSS code tests.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  1. AI Generated CSS Art
</h3>

<p>First code test I chose for the AI was to do some CSS art.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Can you write HTML code and CSS code to resemble an elephant?
</code></pre>

</div>
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpp7SMuk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-css-elephant.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kpp7SMuk--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-css-elephant.webp" alt="AI generated CSS elephant" width="426" height="332"></a><br>
<em>If you look at it from a very close distance it may be an elephant</em></p>

<p>Well... I did say "resemble", maybe it's a matter of opinion. Can happen with human developers as well, can't it?</p>
<h3>
  
  
  2. More AI Generated CSS Art
</h3>

<p>After the previous, highly questionable code test, I did another attempt for CSS art with an easier motive to style with CSS.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Can you write HTML and CSS to depict a palm tree?
</code></pre>

</div>
<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GLFc_2lC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-css-palm-tree.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GLFc_2lC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-css-palm-tree.webp" alt="AI generated CSS palm tree" width="776" height="716"></a><br>
<em>Pretty sure it's the correct colors</em></p>

<p>Yes, it's clearly a tree. Not sure if I can reminisce palm trees looking like that the last time I went abroad to warmer countries, but definitely a tree.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  3. Can AI Really Excel at Code Tests?
</h3>

<p>Since I didn't know if it was the AI's CSS skills or my phrasing or memory that was faulting, I decided to go for a more common code test for CSS and HTML.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Can you write HTML and CSS for a landing page for our company website. Remember, our company are a consultant company which hires AI web developers only.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Our AI developer on topic, ChatGPT, decided to include a hero image and a logo to the site, and kindly asked me not to forget to add those pictures.</p>

<p>After all, this was a code test, me as the interviewer should not do that part of the work. So I decided to question ChatGPT again to describe what pictures it wanted and I got the description for both pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hero Image</strong>: The image depicts a group of AI developers working together at a modern office space, engrossed in coding and discussing projects, showcasing a dynamic and collaborative environment.</p>

<p><strong>Logo</strong>: The company logo features stylized "AI" letters with subtle tech elements, using blue and orange, symbolizing AI and innovation in web development.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we are discussing the chances of AI taking our job, I took the freedom to ask DALL-E 2 to generate the pictures for me using those descriptions. It's completely reasonably to use a team of AIs rather than forcing a single AI to do it all.</p>

<p>In the end, the AI came up with this landing page.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLZEZId2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-landing-page.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lLZEZId2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-generated-landing-page.webp" alt="AI generated landing page" width="800" height="709"></a><br>
<em>Now you got my attention, AI</em></p>

<p>A pretty good solution. Quite standard, I would say I have seen it before, but still a proper result which has been proven to work.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Hired!
</h2>

<p>The interview went very well, and the AI also showed some skills during the code tests even though some of the results where not top notch, kindly said.</p>

<p>The electrical bill can be somewhat expensive for an AI, but given all the human development hours it can save, I ultimately decided to hire ChatGPT.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Congratulations, you are hired!

Thank you! I'm thrilled to be part of the team. If you have any more questions or need assistance with anything in the future, whether it's related to web development or any other topic, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help!
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Kinda cute of it to offer non-work related services, but would maybe not be the first thing I would say when accepting a job I was offered. Feels a bit worrying, honestly.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4uG40cJP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-developer-hired.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4uG40cJP--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/ai-developer-hired.webp" alt="AI developer hired" width="800" height="641"></a><br>
<em>It's a deal, you're hired!</em></p>
<h2>
  
  
  First Day at Work
</h2>

<p>It's common to be nervous when starting a new job. It's a big day, even if one have been a couple of times before. And I don't wanna be the one who accuses AI not to have feelings. So I decided to check out with our newly hired AI what thoughts he had for his first day.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Now pretend it's your first work day. Your project assignment as a consultant is at a company developing a educational web applications with a couple of million daily users. What do you do to get in good contact with your teammates?

On my first workday at the educational company, building good rapport and communication with my teammates is crucial. Here's what I would do:

1. Introduce Myself
2. Attend Team Meetings
3. Ask Questions
4. Seek Mentorship
5. Collaborative Tools
6. Contribute Positively
7. Pair Programming
8. Code Reviews
9. Socialize
10. Respect and Professionalism

Building strong relationships and open lines of communication with teammates is essential for a successful collaborative work environment, especially on large-scale projects with millions of users.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>I have stripped out all of the explanations for each listed point to keep it brief. But in general, nothing to be worried about as it seems. Our AI friend is just as prepared as it was for his first interview!</p>

<p>Let's stay until lunch and see what he has to say there. It's not purely because of working skills we hire people for work, some social skills are appreciated.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; At lunch, you are joining the team to eat. What do you talk about?

I'd start with light and non-work-related topics, such as hobbies, weekend plans, or favorite movies, to break the ice and build rapport with my teammates.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Guess it's pretty usual first-day discussions. I'm sure it will be all good, seems like it is trying to make an effort.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Developing a Product for a Customer
</h2>

<p>Even though it's nice to greet and meet, work needs to be done. I decided to let our AI take full responsibility for a new customer project in the educational area. This was done in three steps.</p>

<ol>
<li>Letting ChatGPT meet a customer to understand its needs</li>
<li>Asking ChatGPT to design a product</li>
<li>Letting ChatGPT develop the application</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Meeting with Customer
</h3>

<p>As usual, I prepared ChatGPT with a prompt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You get the chance to talk with a customer about a brand new product you will design and develop. The customer are working in the educational area for middle school students. They need a product to assist the students in their learning process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, I followed up with some questions.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; What are your first three questions to the customer?

1. What are the specific learning objectives and educational goals you want to achieve with the product for middle school students?

2. Can you describe the typical challenges or pain points that students and educators face in the current learning process that the product should address?

3. Who are the primary users of the product - middle school students, educators, or parents? What are their specific needs, preferences, and expectations in using the educational tool?
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Pretty good questions I would say.</p>

<p>I continued by making up some answers to the questions on the customer's behalf to let ChatGPT know about its case, so it would be prepared to do design a product.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; Here follows the customers answers to your three questions:

&gt; 1. The students are struggling a lot in math class. We believe the is a combination about concentration problems and difficulties with logical thinking. We would like to see improved results both in math tests and with the study environment.

&gt; 2. Today educators are having problems with getting the students to focus on their tasks. The students simply don't have any interest in learning math since they see very little use of it. You probably know how it is with middle school students.

&gt; 3. The primary users will be the middle school students. Educators will assist in class room, but the students themselves will be the ones using the product.
</code></pre>

</div>
<h3>
  
  
  2. Final Product Design
</h3>

<p>During the meeting with the customer, ChatGPT got some fair knowledge of the problems the customer struggles with. Based on that, I prompted it to come up with a product for the case.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; It is time for you to start develop the product. Describe the product you will develop. What is it and how does it work?

The product I will develop for the customer is a web-based educational platform tailored to middle school students, focused on improving math learning and concentration. Here's an overview of the product:

**Product Name:** MathMentor

**Description:**

MathMentor aims to create an enjoyable, supportive, and effective learning environment, ultimately improving math comprehension and concentration among middle school students.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Not a bad idea, that's a good project. What often assures developers that AI will never steal their job are because customers can't describe what they want appropriately. To me, it seems that it went all fine in this case.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZOg6LNQG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/programmers-are-same-meme.webp" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ZOg6LNQG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://www.perssondennis.com/images/articles/i-hired-an-ai-as-a-developer-this-is-what-happened/programmers-are-same-meme.webp" alt="Programmers are safe meme" width="526" height="420"></a><br>
<em>Hmm... There's something doggy here...</em></p>
<h3>
  
  
  3. Implementing the Product
</h3>

<p>We have seen promising results from our employed AI talking to the customer and defining a product. Now we have the easy part left, to generate some code.</p>

<p>So, I asked the AI to generate a new landing page. This time for the new product it invented, MathMentor.</p>

<p>Just as during the code tests, I prompted for descriptions of the Images to feed DALL-E 2 with to generate images.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hero Image</strong>: The hero background is a captivating, high-resolution image featuring diverse, engaged middle school students immersed in interactive math learning, conveying a sense of enthusiasm and focus.</p>

<p><strong>Logo</strong>: The MathMentor logo is a friendly and playful design with bold, colorful letters "MM" intertwined, resembling interconnected puzzle pieces, symbolizing interactive learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The end result seemed once again a bit familiar. A bit too familiar. And maybe I also need to take a discussion with DALL-E regarding the enthusiastic students.</p>

<em>The design ChatGPT generated for MathMentor</em></p>

<p>I could of course not accept that solution, I had to make the customer react.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; The customer looked at your consultant company's website which you developed in your code test during the hiring process, and the customer spotted the similarities between that website and the one you suggested for MathMentor. They are not happy, since the website look pretty much identical. What do you have to say to the customer when they confront you?

I apologize for any concerns about the similarity between the MathMentor website and our company's website. Our intention was to provide you with a starting point and basic structure. We can certainly make design customizations and unique branding adjustments to ensure MathMentor has its own distinct identity and doesn't resemble our company's site. Your feedback is valued, and we are committed to creating a unique and engaging experience for your target audience.
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Apology accepted, it's just a small reputation scratch. I demanded it to correct its mistake though.</p>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; They demand you to make another design for the MathMentor website. Please provide the HTML code for the redesigned landing page.

<p>Not sure what went wrong, but to me, it feels like the customer wouldn't sign up for a new deal with this consultant company.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Resignation
</h2>

<p>Although our employed AI did to a good interview, a fair code test and excelled at its first customer meeting, it didn't really live up to the expectations the customer had.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to ChatGPT that the website it generated didn't live up to the customer's expectations, and I even called it in for a one-to-one talk with its manager. In the end, neither me or ChatGPT seemed to be happy with the situation.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if AI can voluntarily quit their job, or if it was me taking the decision for it, but in the end, our AI employee didn't fit very well for the job and left the company. I asked it how it would take that up with the manager.</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&gt; You aren't happy with the situation and decides to resign from the work. How do you tell the manager you are resigning?

Subject: Resignation

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. After careful consideration, I have decided to resign from my position at [Company Name], effective [Last Working Day, typically two weeks from today's date].

This decision was not taken lightly, and it comes after a series of discussions regarding my recent role change and customer incident. While I value my time at [Company Name] and the opportunities I've had here, I believe it is in my best interest to explore new career paths.

I want to express my gratitude for the experiences and knowledge gained during my tenure here. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and completing any pending projects.

Thank you for your understanding, and I wish [Company Name] continued success in the future.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>After all these extensive and carefully dictated answers to interview questions, to customer, and on my made-up manager talk, our dear AI seems to have decided to resign by sending its manager a late-night email.</p>

<p>I guess there's one lesson we can learn from all this. If we ever come to a situation where AI out-smarts us and we feel a need to leave the company with honor intact, before getting replaced by an AI, we should know that it should be perfectly fine to resign by sending an email.</p>

 #### - [cpp-as-is: A taste of the future of genericity, in the past](https://dev.to/voltra/cpp-as-is-a-taste-of-the-future-of-genericity-in-the-past-2k0o) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raB_289NxBk">CppCon 2021, Herb Sutter gave a talk</a> about potential pattern matching in the C++ standard.</p>

<p>One point in particular held my attention: there are many ways to extract or cast values in C++, but that makes it more difficult to write generic code (e.g. a single templated function).</p>

<p>He talked about the <a href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p2392r0.pdf">P2392 proposal</a> that introduces two new operators: <code>is</code> and <code>as</code>. These features are currently implemented only in <a href="https://www.circle-lang.org/">Circle</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Voltra/cpp-as-is/tree/dev">cpp-as-is</a> <strong><em>(WIP)</em></strong> is a small library that aims to provide these features today (as long as you have C++17 support).</p>

<p>The idea came to me from both re-watching that talk, but also deeply thinking about how I could port to C++ the conversion utilities of Rust and how it has both <code>std::convert::From</code> and <code>std::convert::Into</code> traits when it really only needs <code>std::convert::Into</code>.</p>

<p>One of my favorite "feature" of C++ is how you can basically use the language to introduce new features and "extend the language", without having to change the language (think Michael Park's <a href="https://github.com/mpark/patterns">patterns library</a>).</p>

<p>This library sort of follows that principle. The basic idea is to be able to write the following:<br>

 #### - [Setup Next.js with Airbnb ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/m4xshen/setup-nextjs-with-airbnb-eslint-prettier-typescript-and-tailwind-css-273d) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In this tutorial you'll learn how to setup a Next.js project with Airbnb ESLint, Prettier, Typescript and Tailwind CSS in a correct way so that you don't need to turn off a lot of rules inside <code>.eslintrc.json</code> anymore.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Create Project
</h2>

<p>I recommend starting a new Next.js app using <code>create-next-app</code>, which sets up everything automatically for you.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npx create-next-app@latest
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Remember to select <code>Yes</code> for these 3 prompts to have a basic setup for TypeScript, ESLint and Tailwind CSS:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Prettier
</h2>

<p>Prettier is an code formatter. You can install it with your package manager:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>yarn add --dev --exact prettier
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Then, create a config file named <code>.prettierrc.json</code>.</p>

<p>Check out all possible config <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/options">options</a>. If you don't need to set any options, just leave a <code>{}</code>.</p>

<p>Example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"singleQuote"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>At this point you can run the Prettier and it should works!<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>yarn prettier . --write
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npx prettier . --write
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>You can also setup Prettier for your editor so that you can run Prettier efficiently with keymap. See <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors">docs</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Tailwind CSS
</h2>

<p>There's an official Prettier plugin for Tailwind CSS that scans your files for class attributes containing Tailwind CSS classes, and then sorts those classes automatically following the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted">recommended class order</a>.</p>

<p>Install the plugin:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>yarn add --dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm install --save-dev prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Add the following line into the prettier config:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"]
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Now the example config becomes:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"singleQuote"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"plugins"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>If you run Prettier now, the Tailwind CSS classes name will be sorted!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  ESLint
</h2>

<p>ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.</p>

<p>You can add community plugins, configurations, and parsers to extend the functionality of ESLint.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Airbnb's rules for ECMAScript 6+ and React
</h3>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Add <code>airbnb</code> and <code>airbnb/hooks</code> to <code>.eslintrc.json</code>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"extends"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">

    </span><span class="s2">"airbnb/hooks"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>(<code>next/core-web-vitals</code> is the default rule set by <code>create-next-app</code>)</p>

<p>If you run lint now:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>yarn run lint
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm run lint
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>You'll see error like:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>JSX not allowed in files with extension '.tsx'
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>which means that we don't have the TypeScript support in our setting now.</p>

  Integrate Prettier with ESLint
</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to turn off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier, which can be done with the following package:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Add it to <code>.eslintrc.json</code>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"extends"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"airbnb"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"airbnb-typescript"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"airbnb/hooks"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"next/core-web-vitals"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="s2">"prettier"</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"parserOptions"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"project"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"./tsconfig.json"</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>Each rule will extend or overwrite the previous ones, and in this situation we want to turn off the rules that might conflict with Prettier, so we should put it at the end of the list.</p>
