 #### - [Code review - a unique way of debugging](https://dev.to/namatuzio/code-review-a-unique-way-of-debugging-13kp) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>How did you go about finding someone to work with?</strong> </p>

<p>A lot of students had posted around our Slack channel looking for help, which made it very easy to find someone looking for a code reviewer. I told one of my classmates I would look through his repo and ended up sending him mine through a DM.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like testing and reviewing someone else's code? Did you run into any problems? Did anything surprise you?</strong></p>

<p>It was very fun! It provided me with a lot of insight into the many ways a solution could've been built. It also made me realize I have some missing features in my release. I did run into a couple of problems, mainly in the functionality which I will get into later. The most surprising thing about the repo I reviewed was the complexity of the solution. It was very nicely crafted with a lot of techniques used and a variety of files that held either classes or helper functions.</p>

<p><strong>What was it like having someone test and review your code? Were you surprised by anything?</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised by how much I ended up overlooking. Obvious functionalities such as only utilizing text files went completely over my head but were found by my code reviewer, thankfully.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of issues came up in your the testing and review? Discuss a few of them in detail.</strong></p>

<p>There was a relatively large issue where single-file-translation was not working for me. I tried a lot of different things to get it to work on my machine but it didn't seem to work, what made it strange was that folder translations worked flawlessly. One smaller thing I found was that the student forgot to normalize text in the files so adding multiple new lines would add a blank </p>
<p> tag in the HTML conversion.</p>

<p><strong>Provide links to issues you filed, and discuss what you found</strong></p>

<p>As discussed previously, one of the main functionalities didn't seem to work and a smaller bug was present, another issue was that the README didn't feature any installation or usage processes at the time I reviewed the repo. </p>

<p>Link to reviewed repos' issues:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues">https://github.com/Amnish04/til-page-builder/issues</a></p>

<p><strong>Provide links to issues that were filed on your repo, and what they were about</strong></p>

<p>As I said earlier, I mistakenly forgot to include a couple of key things. Firstly I forgot to include some setup instructions within my README, but featured usage instructions. I also forgot to check for .txt files in the single conversion!</p>

<p>Link to my repos' issues:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Namatuzio/tiller/issues">https://github.com/Namatuzio/tiller/issues</a></p>

<p><strong>Were you able to fix all your issues? What was that like?</strong></p>

<p>I was able to fix most and know how to fix the rest, though I wasn't able to implement it in time due to time restraints with family events.</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn through the process of doing the testing and reviewing?</strong></p>

<p>I honestly learned a lot. I never knew having another set of eyes on a project would make it so much easier to debug code and create a stronger solution for a problem. It makes sense, but I'm amazed at how effective it is both for learning and building stronger code consistency. </p>

<p><strong>Ask Clarifying Questions</strong><br>
If you encounter ambiguities or uncertainties in the instructions, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for clarification. It‚Äôs better to seek clarity upfront than to make assumptions that could lead to errors later on.</p>

<p><strong>Create a Checklist</strong><br>
For complex tasks or projects with multiple steps, create a checklist based on the instructions. This can help ensure that you don‚Äôt miss any crucial details along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Prioritize Tasks</strong><br>
Often, instructions come with a timeline or a sense of priority. Be sure to understand which tasks are most critical and need to be addressed first. Proper task prioritization can significantly impact project success.</p>

<p><strong>Communicate Progress</strong><br>
Regularly update your team or supervisor on your progress. in order to ensure that everyone is on the same page and which will go a long way to help prevent any misunderstandings.</p>

<p><strong>Attention to Detail</strong><br>
Pay meticulous attention to detail. In coding, a missing semicolon or a small syntax error can lead to a program‚Äôs failure. In data analysis, overlooking a crucial variable can skew results.</p>

<p><strong>Quality Assurance</strong><br>
Always double-check your work against the instructions. Verify that you‚Äôve met all the requirements and that your output aligns with the intended outcome.</p>

<p>Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are both open-source container orchestration platforms that automate container deployment, scaling, and management. However, some critical differences between the two are important to understand when deciding which solution to use.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--USVBilV6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/martin-martz-RhF4D_sw6gk-unsplash--1--1.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--USVBilV6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/martin-martz-RhF4D_sw6gk-unsplash--1--1.jpg" alt="Top Container Orchestration Platforms: Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm" width="800" height="533"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Kubernetes?
</h2>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes (also known as K8s) was originally designed by Google</a> and is now maintained by the <a href="https://dev.to/anurag_vishwakarma/what-is-cloud-native-4npc">Cloud Native</a> Computing Foundation. It provides a <a href="https://dev.to/anurag_vishwakarma/what-is-langchain-framework-example-32i1-temp-slug-2703434">framework</a> to run distributed systems resiliently across clusters of nodes. Kubernetes coordinates containerized applications across multiple hosts, ensuring there is no downtime during maintenance or when scaling.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Kubernetes Architecture
</h3>

<p>The Kubernetes architecture consists of master and worker nodes. The components include:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9vNonLF3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/Kubernetes_architecture.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9vNonLF3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/Kubernetes_architecture.png" alt="Top Container Orchestration Platforms: Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm" width="800" height="314"></a><br>
<em>Kubernetes architecture consists of master and worker nodes.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Masters:</strong> These oversee orchestration and cluster health. Master components provide a unified view of the cluster and include:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>kube-apiserver:</strong>  The <a href="https://dev.to/anurag_vishwakarma/the-most-popular-apis-rest-soap-graphql-and-grpc-explained-40e6-temp-slug-1920113">API server</a> validates and configures data for pods and services.</li>
<li>
<strong>kube-scheduler:</strong>  This schedules pods across nodes.</li>
<li>
<strong>kube-controller-manager:</strong>  The controller manager runs controllers for replication, accounts, endpoints, etc.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Nodes:</strong> These are the workers that run containerized applications. A node contains services like kubelet and kube-proxy to communicate with the master and run pods.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>kubelet:</strong>  This connects nodes to the cluster and handles pod lifecycles.</li>
<li>
<strong>kube-proxy:</strong>  This maintains networking rules and performs connection forwarding.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://dev.to/anurag_vishwakarma/what-is-the-difference-between-pod-and-container-562k-temp-slug-691730"><strong>Pods</strong></a> <strong>:</strong>  These are a group of one or more containers with shared resources. Pods are the basic units deployed and managed in Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Docker Swarm?
</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a> is Docker's native <a href="https://dev.to/anurag_vishwakarma/bare-metal-vs-virtual-machines-vs-containers-the-differences-jkh">container orchestration tool</a>. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single virtual host for easier container deployment and scaling. Swarm serves the standard Docker <a href="https://firstfinger.in/tag/apis/">API</a> so any tool that communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Docker Swarm Architecture
</h3>

<p>The Docker Swarm architecture comprises managers and workers. The components include:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z4zm5SvD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/Docker_swarm_architecture.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Z4zm5SvD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://firstfinger.in/content/images/2023/08/Docker_swarm_architecture.png" alt="Top Container Orchestration Platforms: Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm" width="800" height="533"></a><br>
<em>The Docker Swarm architecture comprises managers and workers.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Managers:</strong>  These nodes perform orchestration and cluster management. Managers dispatch units of work called tasks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workers:</strong>  These are the nodes that run tasks dispatched from managers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Services:</strong>  This is the definition of the tasks to execute on the worker nodes including container images, ports, replicas, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  
  
  Should you have a Cluster with fewer larger nodes or many smaller nodes?
</h4>



<p><strong>When creating a cluster, one of the first questions that comes up is what type of worker nodes to use and how many of them.</strong>  The total compute capacity of a cluster is the sum of all the constituent node's capacities. There are multiple ways to achieve the desired target capacity of a cluster. For example, if you need a cluster with a total capacity of 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM, you could design your cluster using 4 smaller nodes or 2 larger nodes.</p>

<p><u><b><strong>There are pros and cons to both approaches.</strong></b></u> Few large nodes can result in less management overhead, as it is easier to manage a small number of machines than a large number.  <strong>However, this applies primarily to bare metal servers and not to cloud instances.</strong>  If you use cloud instances, you outsource the management of the underlying machines to the cloud provider.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many small nodes can provide higher availability.  <strong>If you have a cluster with two large worker nodes and you lose one, you lose half the cluster capacity.</strong>  Having multiple worker nodes reduces this risk. For example, if you have a ten-node cluster and you lose one, you lose just 10% of your cluster capacity.</p>

<p>There are other factors to consider as well, such as ease of scheduling containers and node auto-scaling. With a large number of resources allocated to a node, it becomes easier for Kubernetes to schedule containers on a cluster with fewer large worker nodes in comparison to smaller nodes. However, with more nodes in the picture, there is more management overhead in terms of taking care of servers, patching and updating them, and maintaining them.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice between few large nodes or many small nodes depends on your specific needs and requirements. It's important to carefully consider all the factors when designing your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h3>

<p>Kubernetes and Docker Swarm both enable container orchestration through differing architectures and features. Kubernetes is more advanced and configurable, while Docker Swarm is simpler to adopt initially. Consider application needs and environment when selecting an orchestration platform. The right solution can provide automation, resilience, and scalability.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  FAQs
</h3>

<h4>
  
  
  <strong>What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture?</strong>
</h4>



<p>The main components of Kubernetes architecture are the master nodes which manage and control worker nodes. Worker nodes run pod containers and communicate with the master, while pods are a group of containers with shared resources.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  <strong>How does networking differ between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm?</strong>
</h4>



<p>Kubernetes has a more advanced networking model that supports multiple networks per pod, network policies, and IPVS load balancing. Docker Swarm uses host-based routing mesh and overlay networks for container networking across hosts.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  <strong>What types of storage can you use with Kubernetes?</strong>
</h4>



<p>Kubernetes supports a wider range of storage solutions including local storage, public cloud storage like GCP and AWS, network storage like NFS, and iSCSI, and plugins like GlusterFS and Ceph. Docker Swarm is more limited in storage support.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  <strong>When is Docker Swarm a better choice over Kubernetes?</strong>
</h4>



<p>Docker Swarm can be a better choice when you want simpler installation and configuration, requiring less resources and expertise. It works well for smaller clusters running less critical workloads.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  <strong>What security capabilities does Kubernetes provide?</strong>
</h4>



<p>Kubernetes provides role-based access control (RBAC), secrets management, pod security policies to control pod access, and network policies for managing inter-pod and pod-to-service communications. Docker Swarm relies more on third-party or manual configuration for security.</p>

 #### - [Building a Game with Phaser](https://dev.to/ceceliacreates/building-a-mobile-game-with-phaser-and-ionic-vue-building-a-phaser-game-2f74) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Welcome to Part Two of this four-part series on building a mobile game using open source technologies. We'll be using Phaser, along with <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/">Capacitor</a>, and <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/">Vue</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ùì<strong>Are you interested in a video walkthrough version of this blog post?</strong> Let me know in the comments! If there's enough interest I can put one together.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial">source code for this tutorial is here</a>, and I'll reference specific commits throughout so you can see the specific changes for each section.</p>

<p>This post is heavily influenced by the <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1">tutorial from the official Phaser docs</a> (we'll even use the assets they provide as well). I recommend going through the tutorial if you want to learn more about Phaser concepts. We'll keep it pretty high level here for brevity.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll actually walk through making the Phaser game! It's a big section and there are a lot of new concepts to learn, so let's jump right in!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Creating Scenes
</h2>

<p>We talked about scenes briefly last week. Scenes are a core concept in Phaser and other game dev frameworks. You can think of Scenes like Views in a web app, but with some additional flexibility. Your player will navigate between Scenes, and sometimes multiple Scenes can run simultaneously.</p>

<p>Right now we have a single MainScene in our app.</p>

<p>In your <code>game</code> directory, create a <code>PlayScene.js</code> and <code>ScoreScene.js</code> file. We'll work with the <code>PlayScene.js</code> file first, as this will contain the majority of our game.</p>

<p>Add the following code to your Play scene:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// src/game/PlayScene.js</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">Scene</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">phaser</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">PlayScene</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nx">Scene</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">constructor</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">PlayScene</span><span class="dl">'</span> <span class="p">})</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nx">create</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">PlayScene</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>

        <span class="p">});</span>    
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Then, in your <code>game.js</code> file, remove the <code>MainScene</code> class we defined in the last blog post. We'll need to update our import statement and config to include the new <code>PlayScene</code> instead.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>It's not much, but now we have separate files for our scenes, which will make it easier to work with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/commit/571e34a43f8895b251f53ceaa433745264585027">Here is the git commit</a> with the changes for this section.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Adding Game Objects
</h2>

<p>When working with Phaser, almost everything we interact with is a Game Object. Game Objects can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have Physics applied</li>
<li>Be images, text, sprites, etc.</li>
<li>Be Static or Dynamic</li>
<li>Be categorized into Groups</li>
<li>And much, much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>For our game, we'll be working with the following objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/player.png">player</a> sprite that moves left and right with animation</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/platform.png">platform</a> static object that our player walks on</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/leftarrow.png">Left</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/rightarrow.png">right</a> arrows for input to move our player</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/star.png">star</a> object that falls from the top of the screen and increases the score on collision with the player</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/blob/main/public/assets/bomb.png">bomb</a> object that falls from the top of the screen and ends the game on collision with the player</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the <code>public</code> directory in the root of your project, create a new <code>assets</code> folder. Save the above linked images in this folder with the following file names:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>player.png</code></li>
<li><code>platform.png</code></li>
<li><code>leftarrow.png</code></li>
<li><code>rightarrow.png</code></li>
<li><code>star.png</code></li>
<li><code>bomb.png</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Detour: Adjusting Game Window
</h3>

<p>Before we move onto adding Game Objects, we need to make a small fix to our app that I discovered while writing. Right now, we have a collapsible header on iPhone. This could affect our game window size. Update the Play, About, and Scores pages in your <code>/src/views</code> directory to <strong>remove</strong> <code>:fullscreen=true</code> from the <code>&lt;ion-content&gt;</code> component, and remove the entire <code>&lt;ion-header&gt;</code> component and children that is inside <code>&lt;ion-content&gt;</code>. Your updated Page template should look like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// src/views/PlayPage.vue</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">template</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ion</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">page</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ion</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">header</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ion</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">toolbar</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ion</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">title</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Play</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ion-title</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>      <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ion-toolbar</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ion-header</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ion</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">content</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">PhaserContainer</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ion-content</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ion-page</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/template</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span></code></pre>

<h3>
  
  
  Preloading Assets
</h3>

<p>Right now, inside our <code>PlayScene</code> class, we have a <code>constructor</code> and a <code>create ()</code> method. There are two other lifecycle methods provided by Phaser: <code>preload ()</code> and <code>update ()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>preload ()</code> method is used to preload assets that will be used in our game.</p>

<p>Update your <code>PlayScene.js</code> file to preload the assets we just saved. Go ahead and also remove the text in the <code>create ()</code> method.<br>

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The star, bomb, platform, and arrow images are added with <code>this.load.image()</code>, where we pass a unique key and the path for the image file. </p>

<p>The player is loaded using what's called a sprite sheet. A sprite sheet contains multiple poses of our player in the same image. This is helpful for animating our player. We use <code>this.load.spritesheet()</code>, again passing a key and path, but also setting the <code>frameWidth</code> and <code>frameHeight</code> of each individual pose (or "frame") in our image.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Displaying Images
</h3>

<p>Our asset are preloaded, but nothing is showing on the screen! We need to create game objects using our image assets.</p>

<p>Phaser uses pixels for all positioning and scaling. Many examples simply provide hard-coded values, which can work fine on browsers in a desktop device, but not for mobile.</p>

<p>Because of this, we need to do some math to make our displayed images responsive to the user's device screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong> I'd recommend playing around with these values based on the device screen. In <a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/ionitron-game/blob/main/src/game/scenes/PlayScene.js#L79">a more complex example here</a>, I am scaling everything and adding logic checks rather than hard-coding values. However, for simplicity, I'm hard-coding for an iPhone 12 Pro in this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phaser provides <code>this.scale.width</code> and <code>this.scale.height</code> that returns the current screen width and height values. We can use these to calculate the center of our screen and where we should place objects.</p>

<p>If we think about our game layout, we'll need to calculate the height of a game play area, as well as the height of a controls area. This will help us determine where on the Y axis we need to place our platform, player, and arrow controls.</p>

</div>



<p>In the first section, we've calculated the center of the screen. We've also set a <code>controlsAreaHeight</code> to take up about 20% of the bottom of the screen, and the <code>gameAreaHeight</code> to be the difference.</p>

<p>To create a game object, we'll use the relevant <code>add</code> method, passing an X coordinate, Y coordinate, and image key.</p>

<p>Let's break these down individually.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">platform</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">staticImage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">gameAreaHeight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">platform</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">setOrigin</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">refreshBody</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>We've added the platform as a static image, which gives it physics properties so other game objects can interact with the platform. One thing to note here is <code>setOrigin()</code>. By default Phaser positions images based on the <strong>center</strong> of the image. By changing the origin to <code>(0, 0)</code>, I am telling Phaser to position starting from the bottom left corner instead. Whenever we change the position or scale of a static body, we need to tell Phaser to adjust for this change. That is what <code>refreshBody()</code> is doing here.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sprite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">screenCenterX</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">gameAreaHeight</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">player</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>For the player, I'm adding a sprite. For the Y coordinate, I'm doing some math and placing the player at the <code>gameAreaHeight</code>, but <strong>subtracting half the player height</strong>. This is because, again, Phaser positions from the <strong>center</strong> of the image. This results in the player standing nicely on top of the platform. </p>

<p>If I wanted to, I could use <code>setOrigin()</code> to position from the bottom instead, but I wanted to demonstrate how you would position an item by default in Phaser as well.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>For the arrows, I'm sticking with <code>setOrigin(0, 0)</code> because it's easier for me to position based on the lower left corner with the math I'm doing. I'm positioning the arrows 40 pixels (half the size of the arrows) below the <code>gameAreaHeight</code>, the left arrow 10% of the way from the left and the right arrow 70% of the way from the left of the screen edge.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>setInteractive()</code> so that we can assign touch/click handlers to the arrows.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Animating Game Objects
</h3>

<p>If you save what we have so far, you see our player standing on the platform and facing the left. This is because Phaser is using the first frame of our spritesheet by default.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2I1n_WSm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nu6ditc6jr1dxs3bchdr.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2I1n_WSm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nu6ditc6jr1dxs3bchdr.png" alt="Screenshot of app so far" width="494" height="922"></a></p>

<p>Let's set up some animations so when our character moves, we can leverage all the poses in the spritesheet. This code comes mostly from <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part5">the official Phaser tutorial</a>, so I won't dig into too much. I did add a logic check so it doesn't create a new animation if one already exists when the game restarts.</p>

<p>But you can see we are defining an animation key, providing an image key, stating what frames to loop through, and establishing a loop for each animation. The "turn" animation is the player simply facing forward.<br>

<p>Our player is still facing left because we'll leverage these animations once our player starts moving in the next section.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ceceliacreates/phaser-tutorial/commit/cbcf862523ef5f261dd42e4dadc37851dcc481cf">Here is the git commit</a> with the changes for this section.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  Responding to Player Input
</h2>

<p>In order for our player to animate, he needs to move! Let's add some event handlers for our arrow buttons next.</p>

<p>First, we need to make sure our player is ready for the physics of moving and interacting with our game world.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Setting Player Physics
</h3>

<p>Add the following code inside your <code>create ()</code> method, underneath the animations we just added.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// src/game/PlayScene.js</span>

<span class="c1">// sets player physics</span>
<span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setGravityY</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">300</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setCollideWorldBounds</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// adds collider between player and platforms</span>
<span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">collider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">platform</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>For gravity, we could set a default game-level gravity. However, we want our player to move differently than our stars and bombs, so we're setting it on the object directly instead. <code>setColliderWorldBounds()</code> to <code>true</code> means our player cannot go off screen, and adding a collider between the player and platform means the player will stay on top of the platform as he moves.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Adding Event Handlers
</h3>

<p>Now we'll add event handlers for <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events. These will translate to touch events once we're on a mobile device.</p>

<p>Still in our <code>create ()</code> method, add the following:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// src/game/PlayScene.js</span>

<p>We are using two variables, <code>moveLeft</code> and <code>moveRight</code>, to track whether our player is in motion based on what arrows are being pressed.</p>

<p>However, we are not actually telling the player to move yet. Where do we do that? In our <code>update ()</code> method.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Handling movement in update method
</h3>

<p>So far we have primarily been working in our <code>create ()</code> method, which is executed when the game is initialized. </p>

<p>In comparison, the <code>update ()</code> method runs every frame of the game. This is where we can control actions that need to <em>update</em> once the game has already started.</p>

<p>Inside our <code>update ()</code> method, add the following:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

<p>Here, when <code>moveLeft</code> is set to true by the <code>pointerdown</code> event handler, we set the player velocity to move left, and play the <code>left</code> animation. We handle the <code>moveRight</code> boolean change the same way.</p>

<p>By default, our player is not moving in either direction, with the <code>turn</code> animation playing, which results in the player facing forward.</p>

<p>If you save now, you can try it out for yourself!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Dynamically Generating Game Objects

<p>Let's break down what's happening in each block.</p>

<p>First, we are creating a physics group called <code>stars</code>. This is helpful when we have a category of game objects and want the same physics applied to each individual game object in that group. In this case, we are applying a <code>gravityY</code> of 300.</p>

<p>Next, we are writing a function called <code>createStar</code> that creates a new <code>star</code> object within our <code>stars</code> group, placing it at a random X coordinate and the 0 Y coordinate (top of the screen) using the key for our star image.</p>

<p>Finally, we are using <code>this.time.addEvent</code> provided by Phaser to create a loop. This Phaser method works like <code>setTimeout</code>, in that you provide a delay in MS and a callback function. We are also referencing our <code>this</code> object for the <code>callbackScope</code> and setting <code>loop</code> to true so it repeats.</p>

<p>Once you save and refresh, you'll see stars falling from the sky at random X positions and at random intervals between 1 and 1.2 seconds.</p>

<p>We'll repeat the process for our bombs. However, we want our bombs to drop much faster but also appear less frequently.</p>

<p>Add the following code to <code>create ()</code>:<br>
</p>

<p>Now we have bombs that drop every 4.5-5 seconds at a high speed. I also scaled up the bombs with <code>setScale(2).refreshBody()</code> to double the original image size so they are easier to see as they fall.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Adding Collision &amp; Overlap Handlers
</h2>

<p>We are almost done! All we have to do now is handle what happens when our player interacts with the stars and bombs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Adding Colliders
</h2>

<p>You may remember that we added a collider earlier between the player and platform.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">collider</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">platform</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>When we add a collider in Phaser without a callback, the default behavior is for the two objects to simply block or push against each other upon collision, without passing through each other.</p>

<p>We can set a collider with a callback function to complete additional steps when two items collide.</p>

<p>For example, our stars and bombs should not go past the platform. Let's add a collider for these and destroy the star or bomb when it collides with the platform.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code> <span class="c1">// src/game/PlayScene.js</span>

  <span class="nx">bomb</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">destroy</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This code will trigger the callback function whenever the two objects collide, determine which object is the object we went to destroy, then call the Phaser-provided <code>destroy()</code> method on that object. Our stars and bombs should now disappear when they collide with the platform.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Adding Overlaps
</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to add overlap handlers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>increase the game score when our player overlaps with a star</li>
<li>ends the game when the player overlaps with a bomb</li>
</ul>

<p>An overlap is different than a collider in that it only <em>checks</em> if two objects overlap, rather than <em>preventing</em> them from colliding. We'll use overlap for the interactions between our player with stars and bombs.</p>

<p>Add the following, again to your <code>create ()</code> method:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// src/game/PlayScene.js</span>

</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In the first block, we are creating a starting score of 0 and displaying that text on the screen over the platform. This should look familiar to how we created other game objects, passing an X and Y value and then the text to <code>this.add.text()</code>. We can also set CSS values in an object passed to the fourth parameter.</p>

<p>Then, we are creating an overlap between the player and the stars group with a callback function that does four things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Checks which overlap object is the star</li>
<li>Destroys the star</li>
<li>Increases the score by 10 points</li>
<li>Resets the score text with <code>this.scoreText.setText()</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to pass the additional <code>null</code> and <code>this</code> parameters to <code>this.physics.add.overlap()</code> so that we have access to our <code>this</code> object inside the callback function.</p>

<p>We can repeat this for our bombs.<br>

<p>This is similar to our star overlap in that we are checking which object is the bomb, then destroying it. However, after that, we have functionality that handles the end of the game.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="nx">createStarLoop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">destroy</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">createBombLoop</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">destroy</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">physics</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pause</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>These lines essentially stop our game world by destroy the loops that create new stars and bombs, as well as pausing all the physics taking place in the game. </p>

<p>Then, we add "Game Over" text to the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>Finally, we are adding a <code>pointerup</code> event handler that lets the user restart the game. This resets the score to 0 and restarts the game on click/tap. It's important that this event handler is <strong>inside</strong> your overlap callback so it only fires after the player interacts with a bomb.</p>
