<p>This made me dig into the future of type annotations, and what it means for libraries manipulating type hints at runtime. Spoiler alert: It has to do with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/">PEP 563</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The bug
</h2>

<p>I have a Django API (<a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">django-rest-framework</a> - drf) which uses <a href="https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg">drf-yasg</a> to generate an OpenAPI schema at runtime. You don't need to know the intricacies of those libraries, just that API endpoints return serializers, and that drf-yasg inspects them at runtime to generate a schema with the proper fields and types.</p>

<p>Now, the problem arose with a snippet similar to this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">rest_framework</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">serializers</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MySerializer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">serializers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Serializer</span><span class="p">):</span>
   <span class="c1"># This allows to return something that is not a direct
</span>   <span class="c1">#¬†attribute of a model, but a "computed" value (function)
</span>   <span class="n">is_foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">serializers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">SerializerMethodField</span><span class="p">()</span>

   <span class="c1"># The type hint (-&gt; bool) is used by drf-yasg to
</span>   <span class="c1"># guess the proper type is "is_foo"
</span>   <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_is_foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">is_foo</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Here, drf-yasg determines the type of <code>is_foo</code> based on the type hints of <code>get_is_foo</code>. The annotation says <code>bool</code>, so this converts correctly to the OpenAPI schema <code>{"is_foo": "BOOLEAN"}</code>.</p>

<p>However, upon refactoring, I added the following at the top of the file:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">annotations</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Suddenly, the schema became <code>{"is_foo": "STRING"}</code>. What?? (Note that it took me a while to pinpoint that the problem came from this import, but let's keep the story short).</p>

<p>If you understand why, you can stop here. If, like me, you find this utterly confusing and want to understand what is going on, keep reading!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  A brief history of type hints
</h2>

<p><em>(I digress briefly, so feel free to skip this section).</em></p>

<p>In 2006, Python 3 introduced a syntax for adding <em>arbitrary</em> metadata annotations to Python functions (<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3107">PEP 3107: Function Annotations</a>). (Ab)used by many 3rd parties in different ways, Python 3.5 finally formalized the semantics in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/">PEP 484: Type Hints</a> (Python 3.5, October 2014 - see also <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/">PEP 483 ‚Äì The Theory of Type Hints</a>) and added the <code>typing</code> module to the standard library.</p>

<p>Over the years, the type hinting system evolved, offering new syntaxes and meta-classes. This is not only drastically changing the way we write Python code, but also the way we ship it to the masses.</p>

<p>Since Python 3.7, packages can incorporate type information and stubs files, making the life of IDEs and type checkers such as MyPy, pytype, etc. easier (It does, however, make the life of library maintainer a bit more complicated). If you want to know more, read <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/">PEP 561: Distributing and Packaging Type Information</a>.</p>

<p>This is to say, type hints are now really taking off. I would not be surprised to find type hints ubiquitous in a few years. Javascript is taking the same route, deviating from the purely scripted language to something more structured.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  Basics of type hints
</h3>

<p>I wasn't aware of most of the intricacies of type hints until I tried <a href="https://blog.derlin.ch/my-unsuccessful-journey-of-migrating-a-large-django-project-to-mypy">migrating a large project to mypy</a> (a good read if you are in a similar process), but I assume most of you are now familiar with the basics of type hints:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Dict</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Optional</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">List</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Optional</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">]:</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bar</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Note that <code>foo</code> can now be rewritten without imports, thanks to <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/">PEP 585 ‚Äì Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections</a> (Python 3.9, March 2019) and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0604/">PEP 604: Allow writing union types as X | Y</a> (Python 3.10, May 2020):<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre>

</div>






<h2>
  
  
  Introducing PEP 563, or what lies behind future annotations
</h2>

<p>If you ever tried using new type hinting features in old Python versions or struggled with forward references, you may have stumbled upon (and used) the famous <em>future import</em>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">annotations</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Adding this line at the top of the file makes the snippet "work" (that is, not throw exceptions) from Python 3.7. Ever wondered why?</p>

<p>Well, the only thing this import does is turn on <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/">PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Type Annotations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This PEP proposes changing function annotations and variable annotations so that they are <strong>no longer evaluated at function definition time</strong>. Instead, they are preserved in <code>__annotations__</code> in <strong>string form</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Treating all annotations as string <strong><em>at runtime</em></strong> have clear advantages, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>It removes issues with forward references</em>. Annotations can now refer to a name that has not yet been defined.</p></li>
<li><p><em>It gives a simple way to deal with cyclic references</em>. We can import the names when running type checks (<code>if typing.TYPE_CHECKING: &lt;imports&gt;</code>) and leave them out at runtime.</p></li>
<li><p><em>It improves runtime performances</em>. Type hints are no longer executed at module import time, which is computationally expensive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This little trick, turning type hints into strings, also explains why we can use new type hint features in old Python versions. Even if <code>str | None</code> is invalid in Python 3.9 (<code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'NoneType'</code>), the string <code>'str | None'</code> is perfectly fine!</p>

<p>All those advantages explain why PEP 563 is planned to become the default behaviour soon:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>from __future__ import annotations</code> was previously scheduled to become mandatory in Python 3.10, but the Python Steering Council twice decided to delay the change (<a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/CLVXXPQ2T2LQ5MP2Y53VVQFCXYWQJHKZ/">announcement for Python 3.10</a>; <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/VIZEBX5EYMSYIJNDBF6DMUMZOCWHARSO/">announcement for Python 3.11</a>). No final decision has been made yet.</p>
</blockquote>




<h2>
  
  
  The explanation
</h2>

<p>So, back to our bug.</p>

<p>For a long time, the <code>inspect</code> module was the best way to determine a method's return type using annotations. It is what the drf-yasg library uses in <a href="https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg/blob/1.21.7/src/drf_yasg/inspectors/field.py#L616">https://github.com/axnsan12/drf-yasg/blob/1.21.7/src/drf_yasg/inspectors/field.py#L616</a>:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">inspect</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="n">sig</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">signature</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">sig</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">return_annotation</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">bool</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This worked perfectly until <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/">PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Type Annotations</a> came along. When enabled, all annotations are suddenly <code>str</code>, so that was previously the <em>type</em> <code>bool</code> becomes the <em>string</em> <code>'bool'</code>!</p>




<h2>
  
  
  How to get the return type of a function after PEP 563?
</h2>

<p>For now, library maintainers need to assume annotations may or may <em>not</em> be stringized, and support both. This has been made easier for Python 3.10, but the transition will take time. Let's review our options.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  In Python 3.10 and newer
</h3>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Python 3.10 adds a new function to the standard library: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.get_annotations"><code>inspect.get_annotations()</code></a>. In Python versions 3.10 and newer, calling this function <strong>is the best practice</strong> for accessing the annotations dict of any object that supports annotations. This function <strong>can</strong> also ‚Äúun-stringize‚Äù stringized annotations for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To turn on the "un-stringize" feature, simply pass the parameter <code>eval_str=True</code> :<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">annotations</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">True</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">inspect</span>
<span class="c1"># eval_str does the magic
</span><span class="n">ann</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get_annotations</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">eval_str</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">ann</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"return"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nb">bool</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Under the hood, this new function looks up the <code>foo.__annotations__</code> dictionary and calls <code>eval</code> on values of type <code>str</code>.</p>

<p>If you never heard of <code>__annotations__</code>, it is a mutable dictionary <em>"mapping parameter names to the evaluated annotation expression</em>". It was introduced in Python 3.0 in 2006 (see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-3107/">PEP 3107 ‚Äì Function Annotations</a>). As its name suggests, <code>return</code> is a special entry key reserved for return annotations.</p>

<p>Note that <code>inspect.signature</code> is also updated to support <code>eval_str</code>, but it just defers the work to <code>get_annotations()</code>, so better to call the latter directly.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  In Python 3.9 and older
</h3>

<p>In older versions, getting the actual type is tricky, even before PEP 563.</p>

<p>First, as explained in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#accessing-the-annotations-dict-of-an-object-in-python-3-9-and-older">Accessing The Annotations Dict Of An Object In Python 3.9 And Older</a>, just getting the annotation has some flaws. Without going into the details, the safest is to use this code snippet:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_return_annotation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">func</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">ann</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">o</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">__dict__</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'__annotations__'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">ann</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">o</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'__annotations__'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ann</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="p">{})[</span><span class="s">"return"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This can return a <code>type</code>, a <code>str</code>, or <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>In the case of a <code>str</code>, we may need to "un-stringize" it. Again, the doc gives some pointers in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/annotations.html#manually-un-stringizing-stringized-annotations">Manually Un-Stringizing Stringized Annotations</a>, but the gist is to use <code>eval</code> and see if this works. But there are many catches... So what do we do?</p>

<p>From my own experience (and deviating from the docs), I suggest one of two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either give a shot at <a href="https://github.com/shawwn/get-annotations">get-annotations</a>. This is a very small library that backports <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.get_annotations"><code>inspect.get_annotations()</code></a> (with <code>eval_str</code> support ü§ó) to older Python versions. It doesn't have many stars on GitHub but seems to deserve more.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Or try <code>typing.get_type_hints</code>. Python 3.7's doc says "<em>In addition, forward references encoded as string literals are handled by evaluating them in</em> <code>globals</code> <em>and</em> <code>locals</code> <em>namespaces</em>", which roughly translates to "<em>if</em> <code>str</code><em>, I will try my best to still return a</em> <code>type</code>".</li>
</ul>




<h2>
  
  
  A word of caution
</h2>

<p><code>future.annotations</code> lets you use anything as annotations, including features that are not yet available (or even "garbage"). This is very dangerous if you plan on reading types at runtime.</p>

<p>For example, if you are using <code>list[str]</code> or <code>str | None</code> in a version that does not yet incorporate them, any attempt to <em>unstringize</em> the annotation will raise an exception (e.g. <code>unsupported operands type(s) for |</code>).</p>

<p>Thus, the safest (especially for libraries) is to <strong>stick with the features present in the lowest version of Python you support</strong>. In the example above, this means using <code>typing.List</code> and <code>typing.Union</code> instead before Python 3.9.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>The advent of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/">PEP 563: Postponed Evaluation of Type Annotations</a> will greatly change the way Python code can access types as runtime, as it turns all annotations from <code>type</code> to <code>str</code> representing types.</p>

<p>Before this PEP becomes the default (Python 3.12?), it can already be activated by importing <code>__future__.annotations</code>. Any annotation in the same file automatically becomes <em>stringized</em> before being stored in the <code>__annotations__</code> dict.</p>

<p>If a piece of code needs to get the return type of a function (or any other annotation) at runtime, it needs to take this new reality into account.</p>

<p>In summary, here are the different ways of properly getting types at runtime:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>inspect.get_annotations(f)</code> ‚Üí only available for Python 3.10+, it is the new best practice. It deals properly with <em>stringized</em> annotations when <code>eval_str=True</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>inspect.signature(f)</code> ‚Üí properly get the types, but only supports <code>eval_str</code> since Python 3.10.</p></li>
<li><p><code>f.__annotations__</code> ‚Üí dangerous before Python 3.10, due to some quirks. Never access it directly unless you know what you are doing!</p></li>
<li><p><code>get_annotations.get_annotations(f)</code> ‚Üí very small library that offers <code>eval_str</code> starting from Python 3.6.</p></li>
<li><p><code>typing.get_type_hints(f)</code> ‚Üí states in the docs that it will do its best to deal with stringized annotations, but test thoroughly before use.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that stringized annotations let you write anything, but as soon as you try to unstringize them, exceptions will be thrown. So no <code>str | None</code> before python 3.10!</p>

<p>The rapid advancement of quantum computing presents enticing possibilities and potential applications across a range of industries. As investors explore opportunities in this emerging sector, the development of a well-optimized investment portfolio segment becomes indispensable. This article delves into the process of constructing a quantum computing investment portfolio segment using variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. While the majority of the article maintains a non-technical approach, I have dedicated the final section to a closer examination of the underlying code used to create this portfolio segment.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Metric Research:
</h2>

<p>In finance, sigma (œÉ) and mu (Œº) are often used to represent standard deviations and means in statistics, as described in the previous answer. However, in quantum computing and quantum wiring, sigma and mu no longer represent the same concepts, but are related to quantum states and quantum gate operations. The following explains what they mean in quantum computing and why the expected value of a quantum circuit can be calculated from these two pieces of data.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sigma (œÉ) : In quantum computing, œÉ is often used to represent a form of the Pauli matrix, for example, œÉ_x, œÉ_y, and œÉ_z. These matrices are fundamental operators in quantum computing that describe the rotation and measurement of quantum bits (qubits). The œÉ matrix is related to operations and measurements in the quantum circuit, not the dispersion of the data</p></li>
<li><p>Mu (Œº) : In quantum computing, Œº is not usually used to represent a specific concept. It is not directly related to the expected value in quantum computing, but is used to represent the complex amplitudes of quantum states. A quantum state is a state that describes a qubit, which is a linear combination that includes the amplitudes of different ground states.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The expected value calculation of quantum circuits is usually related to the Pauli matrix and the inner product (also known as the expected value) of quantum states. The expected value can be expressed as follows:<br>
E(O)= &lt;Œ®‚à£O‚à£Œ®&gt;<br>
Where E(O) represents the expected value of the operator O, |Œ®‚ü© represents the quantum state, and O represents a Pauli matrix or other quantum operator. This expected value represents the average measurement obtained by applying the operator O for a given quantum state</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Algorithm:
</h2>

<p>The VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) algorithm is an approximate solution method based on quantum computing, commonly used to solve problems in quantum chemistry and materials science. Although it is not specifically designed for the financial sector, it can use the power of quantum computing to solve portfolio optimization problems in the financial sector.</p>

<p>First, the portfolio optimization problem is transformed into a problem in quantum computing. In finance, the goal of portfolio questions is usually to maximize returns or minimize risks, while taking into account the weighting of various assets.</p>

<p>The Hamiltonian is a quantum mechanical concept that describes the total energy of a system and can be used to represent portfolio problems. By constructing a Hamiltonian, the goal of the portfolio problem is transformed into a problem of finding the smallest eigenvalue (ground state energy), where the eigenvalue corresponds to the target value of the optimal portfolio.</p>

<p>In order to simulate the Hamiltonian, an appropriate quantum circuit structure is selected. This circuit usually consists of a series of quantum gate operations that can adjust the parameters in the circuit to optimize the portfolio problem.</p>

<p>Use a quantum computer or simulator to run the VQE algorithm. The VQE algorithm uses a classical computer to continuously adjust the circuit parameters to approximate the minimum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian as closely as possible. This process may require several iterations until satisfactory accuracy is reached or an optimal solution is found.</p>

<p>Once the VQE algorithm finds the minimum eigenvalue, it can decode the corresponding quantum states and parameters. These parameters can be translated into asset weights in the financial portfolio, so as to obtain the optimal portfolio allocation.</p>

<p>Finally, the performance of the obtained portfolio allocation is evaluated, including return, risk and other indicators. If needed, the configuration can be further optimized to meet specific investment objectives and constraints.</p>

<p>Amazon Braket is a fully managed quantum computing service designed to help accelerate scientific research and software development in quantum computing. Users can develop quantum programs using Amazon Braket SDK through local Jupyter Notebook/IDE or Amazon console, and call Amazon Cloud Technology to provide quantum hardware or simulation resources to run quantum computing programs.</p>

<ol>
<li> Before using Boto3, you need to set up authentication credentials for your AWS account using either the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">IAM Console</a> or the AWS CLI. You can either choose an existing user or create a new one.
For instructions about how to create a user using the IAM Console, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console">see Creating IAM users</a>. Once the user has been created, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey">Managing access keys</a> to learn how to create and retrieve the keys used to authenticate the user.
If you have the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> installed, then you can use the aws configure command to configure your credentials file:
aws configure
Alternatively, you can create the credentials file yourself. By default, its location is ~/.aws/credentials. At a minimum, the credentials file should specify the access key and secret access key. In this example, the key and secret key for the account are specified in the default profile:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
You may also want to add a default region to the AWS configuration file, which is located by default at ~/.aws/config:
[default]
region=us-east-1
Alternatively, you can pass a region_name when creating clients and resources.
You have now configured credentials for the default profile as well as a default region to use when creating connections. See Configuration for in-depth configuration sources and options.</li>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h-Wn6QCU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgs6th9kebamy2bx0e4i.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h-Wn6QCU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sgs6th9kebamy2bx0e4i.gif" alt="Lets do this" width="576" height="576"></a></p>

<p>Make sure you take a moment to identify your interests and skills before you start searching for open-source projects. This is extremely important because defining what sparks your excitement will be your fuel to start this journey. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Goals and Interests
</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about what gets you out of bed in the morning and drives you to want to code and contribute to this vast world called open-source! Are you passionate about security, web development, machine learning, or mobile app development? Also, determine your programming languages of proficiency, frameworks you're comfortable with, and areas you'd like to explore further.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Open Source Collaboration using GitHub
</h2>

<p>Numerous platforms and directories host a plethora of open-source projects, making your search more manageable. GitHub is a central hub for open-source collaboration, offering a user-friendly platform for hosting, sharing, and collaborating on software projects. They are just one of the many SCMs (Source Code Managers) but for the simplicity of this article, I will be using it to demonstrate how to explore the world of open source. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Explore Platforms and Directories
</h2>

<p>Now that we have a clearer direction on what sparks your interests, let's take a look at how to find open-source projects that you can start contributing to. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Evaluate Project Health
</h2>

<p>Once you've found a project that piques your interest, assess its health and activity. Look for signs of an active community:</p>

<p><strong>Recent commits:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Frequent commits indicate ongoing development.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Open issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A balance between open and closed issues suggests an active issues tracking process.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pull requests:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Open pull requests and merged ones indicate collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Community engagement:
</h2>

<p>A good place to start is to look for project ‚ÄúDiscussions‚Äù or an external community such as Slack or Discord. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DhgFiQ4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rr3r8airzelt7ysrpyvc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--DhgFiQ4e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rr3r8airzelt7ysrpyvc.png" alt="Github communities" width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>Engage with the project's community by introducing yourself, asking questions, and expressing your interest in contributing. Being an active part of the community enhances your chances of finding a suitable project, not to mention it‚Äôs a great way to network and make friends.</p>

<p>If you are curious, <a href="https://discord.boxyhq.com">BoxyHQ‚Äôs Discord</a> is an active place to learn more about how contributors interact. This is also a place to start asking questions to find out how you can start contributing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Time to Get Started
</h2>

<p>Before you commit to a project, thoroughly read its documentation and contribution guidelines. These documents provide insights into the project's structure, coding standards, and expectations for contributors. It's important to be aligned with the project's values and procedures.</p>

<li><p>What does a Data Scientist Do?</p></li>
<li><p>The Data Science Project Lifecycle</p></li>
<li><p>7 Stage Roadmap for Data Scientist with courses and books</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Having said that! Let‚Äôs deep dive into our Data Science Roadmap.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>What is a Data Science?</strong>
</h2>

<p>Data science is a superpower for comprehending information. It all revolves around the use of computers and specialised knowledge to make sense of data, which is just a tonne of information. Consider data as a huge puzzle with parts all over the place. Data scientists are similar to puzzle solvers. To view the broader picture, they take the bits (of data), clean them up, and merge them. To uncover hidden patterns and solutions, they employ mathematical and computational methods.</p>

<p>Simply, data science is the art of finding valuable insights using Statistics, manipulation, visualization and deep learning model creation on the given or extracted data.</p>

<p>Supercool!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Data Science vs. ML Engineer vs. Data Engineer
</h2>

<p>Three unique professions within the data and analytics industry are data science, machine learning (ML) engineer, and data engineering, each with its emphasis and duties.</p>

<p>A <strong>Data Engineer</strong> focuses on maintaining data pipelines, data warehouses and data lakes, ensuring data quality and reliability. <strong>ML Engineer</strong> builds and optimizes machine learning models, integrates them into applications and ensures their production efficiency. <strong>Data Scientist</strong> performs exploratory data analysis, develop and apply machine learning algorithms and predict decisions based on their findings.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6vCKkyW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2080/1%2A-Ei4kRgmB7mE87cKllz0OA.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6vCKkyW---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2080/1%2A-Ei4kRgmB7mE87cKllz0OA.gif" alt="Data Science Roles" width="800" height="492"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  What does a Data Scientist Do?
</h2>

<p>Data Scientists should have a clear idea of what their responsibilities are.</p>

<p>So, Let‚Äôs take an Example <strong>project</strong> which will explain all of these roles:</p>

<p><strong>Project: Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecommunication Company</strong></p>

<p><strong>The data Engineer</strong> sets up the data infrastructure and <em>Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)</em> data from different sources, the <strong>ML Engineer</strong> <em>builds</em> and <em>deploys</em> the predictive model to make real-time predictions and apply feature engineering to enhance model performance, and the <strong>Data Scientist</strong> leverages the model‚Äôs output to provides actionable <em>recommendations and strategies</em> for retaining customers.</p>

<p>These roles collaborate to create a comprehensive solution that addresses the business problem of reducing customer churn for the telecommunication company.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Data Science Project Lifecycle
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eQ8FpJ2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1%2AjzCQSSeDf3SNiPQV1UCPTw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eQ8FpJ2W--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1%2AjzCQSSeDf3SNiPQV1UCPTw.png" alt="Data Science Project Lifecycle" width="800" height="615"></a></p>

<p>The data science project lifecycle is an organised procedure that data scientists use to develop, generate, and deploy data-driven solutions. It consists of several steps and tasks that assist organisations in extracting insights from data to make educated decisions. The specific processes vary based on the project and organisation, however below is a broad outline of the data science project lifecycle:</p>

<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the time the data we extract or supply for our problem or project is not clean. Therefore, data cleaning and preprocessing are important before exploratory data analysis(EDA). EDA helps in understanding the data‚Äôs characteristics and identifying potential relationships between variables.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8RQ2MFG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1%2AXU8DuKgh6eVUV7M0jhY92w.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A8RQ2MFG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2800/1%2AXU8DuKgh6eVUV7M0jhY92w.png" alt="Data Preparation" width="800" height="686"></a></p>

<p><strong>Model building</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Data scientists build algorithmic models using clean data. While building a model, start with simple algorithms or models like Regression then try complex models such as Neural Networks. Assess the model performance using evaluation metrics specific to the problem such as F1, RMSE etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vNvKcL3P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9916/0%2AEF699FfXEqfNlSGv" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vNvKcL3P--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/9916/0%2AEF699FfXEqfNlSGv" alt="Photo by [William Daigneault](https://unsplash.com/@williamdaigneault?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral)" width="800" height="533"></a></p>

<p><strong>Data Insights</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>To acquire insights into the situation, interpret the model‚Äôs predictions and feature relevance. Data visualisation and clear explanations should be used to communicate findings to stakeholders.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole project should be documented, including data sources, preprocessing methods, model information, and findings. Make detailed reports or presentations for stakeholders.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model Monitoring</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The practice of continually following and analysing the performance of machine learning models deployed in a production setting is known as model monitoring in data science. It entails tracking how effectively the model performs over time, recognising any flaws or deviations from predicted behaviour, and taking appropriate remedial steps. Model monitoring is critical for ensuring that machine learning models retain their accuracy and dependability when they meet fresh data in real-world settings.</li>
</ul>

  7-Stage Roadmap for Data Science
</h2>

<p>Data Science is a rigorous field but rewards are also amazing!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A person should choose hard ways to test his conscious and unconscious limits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stages in this roadmap are organised in logical succession to help newbies become skilled data scientists while taking into account the complexity and interconnection of the skills and knowledge areas involved.</p>

  Final Thoughts
</h3>

<p>The stages are ordered sequentially, however, it is crucial to remember that learning is an iterative process. As they handle more sophisticated topics and tasks, learners may return to previous stages. Furthermore, continual learning, networking, and remaining motivated are continuing activities that operate concurrently with the other stages of a data scientist‚Äôs career.</p>
