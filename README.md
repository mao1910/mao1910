 #### - [Discover Bun - A Faster, Modern JavaScript Runtime](https://dev.to/thevinitgupta/discover-bun-a-faster-modern-javascript-runtime-5fob) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PIIahm_e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjrhlmtofass38oajbqf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PIIahm_e--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yjrhlmtofass38oajbqf.png" width="80" height="70"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Bun is the new Javascript Runtime built from scratch to serve the modern Javascript ecosystem.
</h2>

<p>But do we really need more Javascript tools?</p>

<p><a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/d2lcHJTG5Tscg/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/d2lcHJTG5Tscg/giphy.gif" width="500" height="281"></a></p>

<p>Well, the Javascript Space is completely different from 15 years ago when NodeJS was first released.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yearly new releases of <code>ECMAScript</code>.</li>
<li>Typescript becoming the norm because of the enhanced Developer experience.</li>
<li>Use of JSX in almost every development framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have forced the Javascript runtimes to become <code>lighter</code> and <code>faster</code>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Deno - Modern runtime that becamse Jurasic
</h2>

<p>A little bit ago, we got Deno. While it is just No-De reversed as De-No, it does more than that.</p>

<p>It's features are listed on their website : </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wxN6eEFW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tx3clsz1vuiq2a8bg362.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--wxN6eEFW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tx3clsz1vuiq2a8bg362.png" alt="Deno Features" width="800" height="386"></a></p>

<p>But, Deno essentially failed, because : </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deno only really sported "minor features" from a users perspective. It had a cleaner codebase, used up-to-date best-practices, and had better security, but those things are really only "features" to a user, not a product in themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
  
  
  The Technology Behind Bun
</h2>

<p>Bun is a Javascript Runtime. But what does it mean actually?<br>
It starts with an Engine - The Component of a runtime that runs the Javascript code. </p>

<p>We all know V8, the JS Engine behind Chrome and NodeJS.<br>
But Bun uses something different - <code>JavascriptCore</code>.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  Javascript Core is a <code>Performance🚀 focused</code> solution built by Apple 🍎 for the Safari Browser
</h3>

<p>The JS engine cannot work on it's own. So it combines with external APIs and message Queues and the infamous Event loop to create a Javascript Runtime.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--huR1KKNY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vqnm77ue4jdejhklnk7x.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--huR1KKNY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vqnm77ue4jdejhklnk7x.png" alt="Javscript Runtime Internal working" width="800" height="625"></a></p>

<p>In Bun, this is implemented from scratch using <code>Zig</code> which is a <code>low-level</code> general purpose language like C or Rust for building fast applications. </p>
<h3>
  
  
  The above implementation provides better performance and memory management during Start and Runtimes, combined with the promise of mind-blowing speed, you have a real competitor of NodeJS.
</h3>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PmKmZgbU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6p0e0cy5tdvz3dv6je9h.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PmKmZgbU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6p0e0cy5tdvz3dv6je9h.jpg" alt="Bun Meme" width="509" height="500"></a></p>
<h2>
  
  
  Features of Bun
</h2>

<p>Bun has a lot of great features that makes it worthy.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  1. Support for NodeJS packages 🎯
</h3>

<p>Bun is like a Drop-In replacement for NodeJS thanks to the native implementation of 100s of Node modules</p>

<p>Bun also uses the <code>package.json</code> file for dependencies, so less learning curve from NodeJS and <code>bun install</code> is really fast 👇</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---TiLLlX8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zeq16xccepmdt9650fhd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s---TiLLlX8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zeq16xccepmdt9650fhd.png" alt="Bun speed" width="800" height="478"></a></p>
<h3>
  
  
  2. Built in Typescript Support and it's fast ⚡
</h3>

<p>Before the dawn of Bun, running typescript was tedious and slow. Bun comes with built in support for running Typescript in your projects and makes it faster. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4W1S55Cr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2w501y62psor9ox6wdt.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4W1S55Cr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s2w501y62psor9ox6wdt.png" alt="Typescript Bun" width="800" height="457"></a></p>
<h3>
  
  
  3. Support for both CommonJS and ESModules(MyFavorite) 🎉
</h3>

<p>Remember those days where you had to convert your project from the old <code>require</code> syntax to <code>import</code> syntax? Some libraries still not support the import syntax perfectly with Typescript. </p>

<p>This all goes away with Bun. You can write either or both.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--07xaYk4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/86m8z894k6suwc876cy1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--07xaYk4R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/86m8z894k6suwc876cy1.png" alt="Bun Features" width="800" height="800"></a></p>
<h3>
  
  
  4. Built-In Testing Support 💡
</h3>

<p>You love the Test driven development? Or are you just starting with it? It doesn't matter. Because you do not have to go and learn a new testing framework to do the job. </p>

<p>Bun comes with built-in testing support, and so it is much faster from the other ones out there.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pBSGy7BG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bgi5m2ywckerlag3yuk9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pBSGy7BG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bgi5m2ywckerlag3yuk9.png" alt="Bun testing Benchmarks" width="800" height="547"></a></p>
<h4>
  
  
  Enough talk, let's see some examples of using Bun 📌
</h4>
<h2>
  
  
  Installing Bun
</h2>

<p>Installing Bun is as simple as below :<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>curl <span class="nt">-fsSL</span> https://bun.sh/install | bash
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Setting up a Server
</h2>

<p>Ready to develop your own service? Create a new file : <code>server.ts</code> and add the following code : </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MbojM6qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cptbnrm0fzbohr3ziddo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MbojM6qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cptbnrm0fzbohr3ziddo.png" alt="Bun HTTP Server" width="800" height="800"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Start the server
</h2>

<p>Now to start listening to requests, run the following command(no intermediate step of converting to <code>.js</code> separately) :<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>bun index.tsx
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  React Components with Bun
</h2>

<p>Bun supports .jsx and .tsx files out of the box. Bun's internal transpiler converts JSX syntax into vanilla JavaScript before execution.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_T2cUxV_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bj77oc2k00qcpbi186o1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_T2cUxV_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bj77oc2k00qcpbi186o1.png" alt="JSX With Bun" width="800" height="800"></a><br>
It also works with the above React component.</p>

<p>With the above features and many more, Bun is ready to become the new norm in the Javascript runtime market.</p>

 #### - [sudo apt update && upgrade ?](https://dev.to/scorcism/sudo-apt-update-upgrade--48g3) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>You may have heard or used <code>sudo apt update</code> and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code>, and you must have thought about what these commands actually do.</p>

<p>So, in this blog, we will learn, what these two commands actually do.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  sudo apt update
</h2>

<p>When you enter <code>sudo apt update</code> in your terminal, this command starts a process that refreshes the package list on the system.</p>

<p>Going in depth (-vv):</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Refreshing Packages</strong>: As we know, Linux systems use package managers like APT, which stands for Advanced Package Tool, to manage software packages.<br><br>
These package managers maintain a list of available packages and their versions. So, when you run <code>sudo apt update</code>, the system contacts the package repositories specified in your software sources (usually found in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> or <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</code>) and checks for updates.  </p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Checking Updates</strong>: The package manager queries each repo (in my case, only one) and checks if there are any new packages or updates available.<br><br>
This check is done by comparing the versions of packages in the repository with those installed on your system (side-by-side comparison).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updating the Local Cache</strong>: If any updates are found, the package manager downloads the updated package information and stores it in a local cache on the system. This cache will contain metadata about the available packages, such as their names, versions, and dependencies. This will be used when we'sudo apt upgrade`.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: An update doesn't actually include any updates; it only refreshes the list of available packages and their versions on the system.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  sudo apt upgrade
</h2>

<p>This command is usually performed after <code>update</code> because to update the packages, we need to have the new versions of the packages.  </p>

<p>This upgrades the installed packages on the system.</p>

<p>Going in depth (-vv):</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Package Selection</strong>: The package manager checks the local cache, which was updated during the previous <code>sudo apt update</code> command. It identifies which installed packages have newer versions available in the repositories by comparing the old versions with the newer versions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dependency Resolution</strong>: If there are updates available, the package manager checks for any dependencies required by the updated packages. It ensures that the installation or upgrade won't break any existing software by resolving and installing any necessary dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upgrading Packages</strong>: Once the package manager has determined which packages to upgrade and resolved any dependencies, it begins the upgrade process. It downloads the updated packages from the repositories and replaces the older versions installed on the system with the new ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configuration Updates</strong>: In some cases, when upgrading a package, you might be prompted to review and approve changes to configuration files. The package manager provides options to keep your current configuration, use the new one, or review the differences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Completion</strong>: After upgrading the selected packages, the package manager provides a summary of the changes, including the number of packages upgraded and any held back due to conflicts or other issues.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>:  <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> upgrades the packages by installing the new verison of the packages.</p>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>I have been to over 20 calls. <br>
Many people asked me: <strong>What platform should I post on?</strong><br>
I think that’s a valid question but the wrong question to ask. <br>
The real question is: <strong>What platform should I launch on?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--peQcjBAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit%3Dscale-down%2Cformat%3Dauto%2Conerror%3Dredirect%2Cquality%3D80/uploads/asset/file/65006e14-8b16-44f1-85e7-b7476a47ec3e/ezgif.com-resize__24_.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--peQcjBAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit%3Dscale-down%2Cformat%3Dauto%2Conerror%3Dredirect%2Cquality%3D80/uploads/asset/file/65006e14-8b16-44f1-85e7-b7476a47ec3e/ezgif.com-resize__24_.gif" alt="Launch" width="800" height="423"></a></p>



<h2>
  
  
  Your blog 📄
</h2>

<p>If you are in tech and want to grow your product, you need a blog that can be good for: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Motivated developers who wish to learn more about you. </p></li>
<li><p>Developers who are doing research about a problem and want to find a solution (SEO). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t like to discuss other benefits, such as credibility and education, that can be for another post. </p>

<p>Now that we have established the importance of a blog, why would you want to use an external blog for your content?</p>



<h2>
  
  
  Your external blog 📜
</h2>

<p>What if: </p>

<ul>
<li>People are not aware that they have a problem. (Product without market dominator, such as Novu). </li>
<li>SEO has a meager amount of traffic, and the competition is stiff. </li>
<li>You don’t have enough time to wait for long-term channels. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can use external blogs</strong>. They have a lot of mixed visitors who scour their platform daily and might be interested in what you offer.<br>
Those platforms work in the <strong>“marketplace”</strong> mode, where they promote interesting and trending articles. </p>

<p>Nothing stops you from posting your article on your website blog and then posting your articles to all the other platforms with a <strong>canonical link</strong> back to your website. I used a <strong>freelancer on Upwork</strong> for a few dollars to post my articles on DEV, Hashnode, Hacknoon, and Medium whenever I have a new article. </p>

<p>And for the question, “<strong>What platform should I post on?</strong>” The answer is: all of them.</p>



<h2>
  
  
  Traffic to launch 🚀
</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, the biggest question is, <strong>“What platform should I launch on?”</strong><br>
When you launch something, you send every possible traffic you currently have: Social Media, Newsletter, etc. to the platform of your choice. Your main goal is that the platform will reward you with the traffic you send. Here are my thoughts about the different platforms: </p>



<h3>
  
  
  Medium
</h3>

<p><a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is a generalized platform, and it has the most significant amount of audience for developers. If you managed to trend on Medium, you might get tens of thousands of developers reading your content. But it’s hard.</p>

<p>If you are starting, here is what I would do: </p>

<p>I would not put my launch on Medium. I will post my articles there regularly, and after a while, some publications will contact you and give you the ability to publish the post on their feed. Use it, and always post on their feed. I play with my publications between <a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io">Javascript in plain English</a>, <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io">Bits and Pieces</a>, and <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io">Dev Genius</a>. After a while, your audience on Medium will grow, you will get more followers exposed to your new articles, and your initial traffic can significantly increase. </p>

<p>Here is a trick I really liked from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielweinberger">Ariel Weinberger</a>, founder of <a href="https://pezzo.ai">Pezzo</a>. </p>

<p>Ariel has the most extensive Udemy course about NestJS. When he has a NestJS-related article, he sends people to the article on Medium and gets thousands of likes. And you can do the same with different traffic sources you have. </p>

<p>Once you have a vast audience, you can feel comfortable to launch on Medium. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M9qFcGo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yoho3pqklg5so40fktv4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M9qFcGo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yoho3pqklg5so40fktv4.png" alt="Medium" width="800" height="452"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  DEV
</h3>

<p><a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a> is my favorite platform to launch; getting your article trending there requires meager traffic. Their algorithm is still young, so you can quickly bring enough traffic and likes to the platform to be on the top feed. </p>

<p>I had articles there reaching 100k views with a minimal amount of marketing. </p>

<p>The platform consists mainly of juniors and Javascript developers. You acquire an audience fast there; I have more than 11k followers in one year. </p>

<p>I feel like the platform has started getting less traffic than in the past.<br>
It’s good enough for now, but let’s see what happens next year. </p>

<p>I am a big advocate for DEV, and <a href="https://github20k.com/blog">my blog</a> contains many tricks to get your articles trending there. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cN2TiDxu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wx0v1qov6tjio8b1kyyn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cN2TiDxu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wx0v1qov6tjio8b1kyyn.png" alt="DEV" width="800" height="400"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  Hashnode
</h3>

<p><a href="https://hashnode.com">Hashnode</a> is an interesting platform. It’s a blog that consists of many blogs. And on the main, there is a “Featured” section for trending articles. </p>

<p>I think DEV made a better approach since when I go to somebody's article on DEV, I stay on the DEV website so that I might be exposed to other people's articles. On Hashnode, you remain in the personal blog, so the traffic is not circulating. As a result, I feel that Hashnode has much less traffic than DEV. </p>

<p>I was featured on Hashnode multiple times and got little traffic. </p>

<p>What I do feel is that </p>

<p>They get new features rapidly outside compared to DEV </p>

<p>The owner of the platforms is very active daily there and helps articles out. </p>

<p>I think there will be a significant change there in the coming years. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uiyxwLZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27u2o6izsez079pe8pv4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uiyxwLZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27u2o6izsez079pe8pv4.png" alt="Hashnode" width="800" height="430"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  Hackernoon
</h3>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hackernoon</a> it’s the weirdest platform of all of them in terms of design. You can post articles. You have to “Submit” them. They also charge companies to post. I had one piece there, and the results were “meh” compared to posting on DEV. The platform itself is super complicated, and the UX is awful. I don’t even post there regularly. </p>

<p>I might lack information about this platform as I am not motivated to explore it deeply. Do you think you know better what to do with it? Let me know.</p>
