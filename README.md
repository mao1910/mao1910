 #### - [Baby steps to instantly improve your React project](https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/baby-steps-to-instantly-improve-your-react-project-56o2) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>React has established itself as a leading library for building dynamic user interfaces. While it's easy to get started with React, mastering it can be a continuous journey. To help you along the way, here are four React tips that will instantly improve your code and make your React projects more efficient, maintainable, and enjoyable.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Use Functional Components with Hooks
</h3>

<p>Functional components are a game-changer in React. They allow you to write cleaner, more concise code compared to class components. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components can now manage state and side effects, making them even more powerful.</p>

<p>Consider this simple example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">useState</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">useEffect</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Counter</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">setCount</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">useState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="nx">useEffect</span><span class="p">(()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">`Count: </span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">]);</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Count: <span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">button</span> <span class="na">onClick</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">setCount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Increment<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">Counter</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Using functional components with Hooks is the modern way to write React code and should be your default choice when creating new components.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  2. Destructure Props and State
</h3>

<p>Destructuring is a powerful technique in JavaScript that can make your code more concise and readable. When working with props and state in React, use destructuring to access the values you need directly.</p>

<p>For instance:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">UserCard</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">avatar</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">avatar</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="na">alt</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">'s avatar`</span><span class="si">}</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h2</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nx">email</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">div</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Destructuring not only reduces verbosity but also makes it easier to see at a glance what props your component relies on.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders
</h3>

<p>React re-renders components when their state or props change. However, you can optimize your code to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This can be achieved by using <code>React.memo</code> for functional components or <code>PureComponent</code> for class components.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="c1">// Using React.memo for functional components</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">MemoizedComponent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">memo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">MyComponent</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Using PureComponent for class components</span>
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">MyComponent</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nx">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PureComponent</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>These optimizations can significantly boost your app's performance, especially when dealing with complex components.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  4. Organize Your Code Structure
</h3>

<p>Maintaining a clean and organized codebase is crucial for long-term project success. Consider structuring your React code into separate folders for components, containers, and other logical groupings.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>src/
  components/
    Button.js
    Header.js
  containers/
    HomePage.js
    UserProfile.js
  utils/
    api.js
    helpers.js
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Using such a structure helps you locate and update code more efficiently, and it's also more readable for other developers who might join your project.</p>

<p>Happy coding! ✨</p>

 #### - [Enhanced Image Generation With Stable Diffusion and Roop.](https://dev.to/jamesbright/enhanced-image-generation-with-stable-diffusion-and-roop-1c49) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In this post, we will go through the installation process and usage of stable diffusion for text-to-image or image-to-image generation.<br>
text-to-image generation has to do with generating realistic images by using just text prompts, while image-to-image takes the game a little bit further by using a sample image in addition to test prompts to generate ultra realistic images that has features of the sample image.<br>
Adding roop AI model to the picture further enhances the art by improving the quality of image generated to a perfection level. we will see how shortly, so let's started.</p>
<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Install Stable Diffision</strong>
</h2>

<p>First, we need to install AUTOMATIC111 for stable diffision  on our system. i will be going through with the installation for mac, but not to worry windows and linux has similar process, you only need to use their respective package managers as AUTOMATIC111 runs solely on the terminal with a web ui on the browser.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Install homebrew package manager on mac</strong><br>
If homebrew is not yet installed on your mac, please open a command line like <a href="https://iterm2.com/downloads.html">iterm2</a> and run the commands below to install homebrew.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zrLMEnep--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/texlbte88x263xoiozfe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--zrLMEnep--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/texlbte88x263xoiozfe.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="520"></a></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: install additional packages</strong><br>
After the installation completes, we need to install several other packages like python(if not installed), cmake, protobuf, rust, git, and wget. run the command below to install them.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>brew install cmake protobuf rust python@3.10 git wget
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Step 3: Clone AUTOMATIC111 Repo</strong><br>
To make AUTOMATIC111 work on the local environment which is our macbook, windows or linux, we need to get a copy of it saved locally. we can achieve that by cloning it. cd into the home directory (cd $HOME) and run the command below to do that.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cd $HOME &amp;&amp; git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Step 4: Download the model file.</strong><br>
Once we have gotten a copy of AUTOMATIC111 for stable diffusion, next would be to download the model. please note that it is about 4GB of data, so you might want to make a coffee while it downloads.<br>
<a href="https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt">v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Move models file to model directory</strong><br>
When download is completed, you need to move the model .ckpt file to stable-diffusion-webui/models/Stable-diffusion folder which is inside the AUTOMATIC111 we cloned.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MJ30Ufj2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bh8ly17htiulvsljvt4e.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MJ30Ufj2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bh8ly17htiulvsljvt4e.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="380"></a></p>

<p>After doing so, the folder will contain two files as above.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Download Roop model</strong><br>
Download Roop inswapper model and place it same way as above but in the models/roop folder. when done the folder will look as below.<br>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krOLgjW2tAPaqV-Bw4YALz0xT5zlb5HF/view?pli=1">inswapper_128.onnx</a></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tF_RDORb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhft6zbnfvu49hcposc3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tF_RDORb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mhft6zbnfvu49hcposc3.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="375"></a></p>

<p><strong>Finally: Run AUTOMATIC111</strong><br>
To run AUTOMATIC111 and load the web ui in browser, enter the command below. please note that this might take a while on the first run as there are additional packages to be downloaded.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>cd ~/stable-diffusion-webui
./webui.sh --precision full --no-half --skip-torch-cuda-test
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>please skip the additional options if you are using a GPU enabled device. just run<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>./webui.sh 
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>the image below on the terminal..</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1SqGvuI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwr0pgjwyin888qu9yhu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1SqGvuI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qwr0pgjwyin888qu9yhu.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="500"></a></p>

<p>indicates that the webui has been loaded successfully.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1Nw8MN8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z6zq315qr688qy8o36wh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--k1Nw8MN8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/z6zq315qr688qy8o36wh.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="500"></a></p>

<p>finally we can start generating some cool images. let's enter a simple prompt "image of monalisa in a wonderland, photo realistic, colorful, hyper sensitive with birds and windy background".<br>
enter the prompt in text2img box and click on generate button. then relax a bit while our image gets generated.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0gF60tlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03esmex3k8acdc1s1ply.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0gF60tlM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/03esmex3k8acdc1s1ply.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="500"></a><br>
After some minutes, our image gets successfully generated as you can see. Did pretty well for a painting right?, it also took into consideration the elements in the prompt. but we can do much better.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Roop to the picture</strong><br>
This is where Roop comes into play, to generate high quality content, we need to enable roop extension and use img2img to feed in a sample image we can use for the generation.<br>
click on "extension tab", then "install from url". enter github repo link of roop <a href="https://github.com/s0md3v/sd-webui-roop">sd-webui-roop</a> and click "Install".</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzOHLbQI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5jsilk6tpddsi29mpoq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--qzOHLbQI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e5jsilk6tpddsi29mpoq.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="500"></a></p>

<p>next click on img2img select an image, scroll down and click on roop. upload yet another image also make sure "enable" is checked then enter some prompt and click on generate. you will be amazed at the result. i generated the image below following the steps with a simple prompt "as a pirate".</p>

<p>Besides, the two great men in the source photos are Salva and Julien. my mentors at ALX/Holberton school. I don't even know if doing this is legal 🤭.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Roop with stable diffusion brings a whole new level to image generation with AI, there's a lot of options you can try to see which works best...like selecting a sampling method, batch count range, an upscaler and so on. I encourage you to check them out.<br>
Also note that with AI there's always room for improvement and new things to learn.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading 🤗.</p>

 #### - [CTF Challenges: Reconnaissance](https://dev.to/therealchiwoo/ctf-challenges-reconnaissance-1bl5) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>Brief Overview</strong></p>

<p>Now that our previous challenge has been solved, it's time to move on to the next topic. Like I mentioned before, MetaCTF provides 8 different topics of CTF problems, and this time, we are going to take a look at Reconnaissance.</p>

<p><strong>What is Reconnaissance?</strong></p>

<p>For big words like this, I swear Google is my best friend. In Cybersecurity, Reconnaissance is the information-gathering stage of ethical hacking, where you collect data about the target system. To simply put, we use techniques like foot printing and scanning to discover and collect information about a system! Think of it as... I guess a hacker gathering/collecting information about the target system!</p>

<p><strong>CTF Reconnaissance Problems</strong></p>

<p>For this section, I'm going to do a super duper easy peasy simple problem that allows you to understand the very basic definition of Reconnaissance, and a more difficult problem that can demonstrate the subject differently.</p>

<p><strong>KANYE WEST???</strong></p>

<p>Ok, let's take a look at this easy problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tjff7h4m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5oh627gxfczvi2h9uknk.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Tjff7h4m--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5oh627gxfczvi2h9uknk.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="155"></a></p>

<p>As mentioned previously, ethical hackers use reconnaissance to gather information about their target. In this instance, it is the Ye himself!</p>

<p>This problem shows the surface level definition of reconnaissance, as it makes us gather information about Kanye's iPhone password. With a simple Google search, we find his password: 000000.</p>

<p><strong>Under ATT&amp;CK</strong></p>

<p>Now onto something a little more difficult...</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SKe7aVF7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n1a55gwrj307rg92ffr1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SKe7aVF7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n1a55gwrj307rg92ffr1.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="232"></a></p>

<p>At first, I had a difficult time understanding the problem. It had too many acronyms that I wasn't familiar with, so I decided to click on the hint: <a href="https://attack.mitre.org">https://attack.mitre.org</a>.</p>

<p>When I went on the website, there was a subsection that specifies 3 different categories for attacks: Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS. </p>

<p>Going back to the CTF problem, it states <em>"what other Initial Access mechanism did the attacker use?"</em> When browsing through the 3 subcategories, I wasn't particularly sure on which one to click. With a little more research, I stumbled across this website: <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/mitre-attack">https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/endpoint-security/mitre-attack</a>.</p>

<p>In the website, it mentions that the Enterprise ATT&amp;CK Matrix contains a sub-matrices that focuses on pre-attack activities (PRE Matrix), attacks against specific OS (Windows, Linux, and macOS Matrices), network infrastructure attacks (Network Matrix), cloud infrastructure attacks (Cloud Matrix), and attacks against containers (Containers Matrix). </p>

<p>When going back to the question, it does seem like the problem wants us to research more into the Enterprise tactics.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--luhk7Zl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gwnl2zdevo2a4bycnu2g.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--luhk7Zl2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gwnl2zdevo2a4bycnu2g.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="474"></a></p>

<p>When I click on the Enterprise Tactics, there are a lot of sections within it. The CTF problem states that there was a "Valid Accounts" technique, and another technique with Initial Access Mechanism.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PYkcENwT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzamg157q39qdt0esqnb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PYkcENwT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vzamg157q39qdt0esqnb.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="563"></a></p>

<p>After clicking on the Initial Access, there were a total of 9 techniques I found. I was able to narrow it down because the CTF problem stated the Threat Actor was able to get onto our network by using a VPN, which was the "External Remote Services: T1133".</p>

<p>This problem did take a lot of time, as I was a little bit confused on the 3 sections: Enterprise, Mobile and ICS. </p>

 #### - [What is your Why?](https://dev.to/acoh3n/what-is-your-why-j9b) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>I believe we all entered the field of programming for various reasons. It could be to earn a living, pursue a sought-after career, or simply because we love building stuff. Whatever the reason, we're here.</p>

<p>However, if I'm being perfectly honest, while all these are good reasons, none would provide me with more than the bare minimum level of happiness at what I do almost every day for many hours.</p>

<p>Yet, while I had my fair share of miserable days on the job like everyone else, more often than not, I am truly eager to do my thing at work. </p>

<p>So today, while I was running, I found myself in a bit of an introspective mood and wondered what is my personal Why? Why do I still love programming so much after all these years. </p>

<p>I always knew it had something to do with people. Seeing someone using something I wrote and maybe even liking it never ceases to give me a kick. But I felt there was a deeper desire. </p>

<p>After a little back and forth with myself I reduced it to something that felt really true for me: <strong>to reduce the suffering of someone else</strong>. Okay, I know it sounds a bit overly dramatic, but hear me out here for a minute. </p>

<p>Our profession is riddled with sharp objects we all occasionally bump into. People much smarter than myself say that it takes <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">a very long</a> time to even begin to master it, there is formidable math and sophisticated algorithms lurking at every corner, then there are new languages, tools, frameworks and paradigms jumping on us every other day that threaten to undermine everything we've learned for the past however many years. </p>

<p>So when I get to brighten someone's day through my work in even the smallest way, damn it it feels good. </p>

<p>It could be a user that with the help of something I wrote suddenly feels much more productive, or it could be as "small" as assisting a colleague by showing them how to use some tool that I take for granted, but is life-changing for them. </p>

<p>That's why I relish at the opportunity to spend that extra hour at making my API just a tiny bit simpler, or clean up and refactor some messy code, or write that extra page of documentation or test. Because someone (including myself) will experience just a tiny bit less frustration and pain down the road when they try to use it. </p>

<p>And whenever I get to see it first hand it gives me the energy to wake up the next day and do it all over again. </p>

<p>So now I'd like to invite you to find your personal Why, and to please share it with us.</p>

 #### - [Extensões do Visual Studio Code para um Front-end](https://dev.to/manzoliric/extensoes-do-visual-studio-code-para-um-front-end-2pgk) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hoje vim trazer extensões do Visual Studio Code que eu uso e que me ajudam muito no dia a dia, esse post foi inspirado no post <a href="https://dev.to/laryssa/extensoes-do-visual-studio-code-para-um-sre-2nj5">Extensões do Visual Studio Code para um SRE</a> da <a href="https://dev.to/laryssa">Laryssa Araujo</a> onde ela mostra as ferramentas que ela usa no dia a dia como uma SRE.</p>

<p>Não vou falar sobre todas as extensões que eu tenho instalado aqui, tenho algumas para mexer com Elixir/Phoenix, Docker e etc... vou falar apenas das que eu mais uso e que me ajudam no dia a dia como Front-end.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag">Auto Rename Tag</a>: Essa extensão é muito útil para quem trabalha com HTML, ela renomeia a tag de abertura e fechamento automaticamente, evitando que você tenha que ficar renomeando as tags manualmente.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker">Code Spell Checker</a>: Essa extensão é muito útil para corrigir erros de digitação, ela verifica a palavra e mostra se existe algum erro de digitação, exemplo quando escrevemos <code>lenght</code> ao invés de <code>length</code>, que acontece muito comigo.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-portuguese-brazilian">Brazilian Portuguese - Code Spell Checker</a>: Essa extensão é uma extensão da extensão anterior, ela adiciona um dicionário de palavras em português, para que a extensão anterior possa verificar as palavras em português.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SimonSiefke.svg-preview">Svg Preview</a>: Essa extensão mostra uma prévia do SVG direto no VSCode, assim você não precisa abrir o arquivo no navegador para ver o svg.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme">Community Material Theme</a>: Essa extensão é apenas o tema que eu mais gosto, gosto de usar a versão <code>Material Theme Darker</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme">Material Icon Theme</a>: Essa extensão é apenas o tema de ícones que eu mais gosto.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost">Import Cost</a>: Essa extensão mostra o tamanho do pacote que você está importando, assim você pode ver se o pacote é muito grande e se vale a pena usar ele.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens">Git Lens</a>: Essa extensão é bem completa, tem muita coisa, mas para falar a verdade eu uso muito ela para verificar quem fez a última alteração no arquivo direto no VSCode e também conseguir ir direto para o arquivo no GitHub ou Pull Request.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>: Essa extensão não tem muito que dizer, é o famoso GitHub Copilot, tem me ajudado bastante a criar códigos que são mais repetitivos,e também funciona muito bem para documentação e comentários.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig">EditorConfig for VS Code</a>: Essa extensão é muito útil para quem trabalha em projetos com várias pessoas, ela ajuda a manter o padrão de código, como por exemplo, <code>indent_style</code>, <code>indent_size</code>, <code>insert_final_newline</code> e etc... criamos um arquivo <code>.editorconfig</code> na raiz do projeto e configuramos o que queremos que seja o padrão.</p></li>
