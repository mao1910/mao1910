 #### - [🎯 Medium vs. DEV vs. Hashnode vs. Hackernoon 🔥](https://dev.to/github20k/medium-vs-dev-vs-hashnode-vs-hackernoon-4ma1) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>I have been to over 20 calls. <br>
Many people asked me: <strong>What platform should I post on?</strong><br>
I think that’s a valid question but the wrong question to ask. <br>
The real question is: <strong>What platform should I launch on?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--peQcjBAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit%3Dscale-down%2Cformat%3Dauto%2Conerror%3Dredirect%2Cquality%3D80/uploads/asset/file/65006e14-8b16-44f1-85e7-b7476a47ec3e/ezgif.com-resize__24_.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--peQcjBAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit%3Dscale-down%2Cformat%3Dauto%2Conerror%3Dredirect%2Cquality%3D80/uploads/asset/file/65006e14-8b16-44f1-85e7-b7476a47ec3e/ezgif.com-resize__24_.gif" alt="Launch" width="800" height="423"></a></p>



<h2>
  
  
  Your blog 📄
</h2>

<p>If you are in tech and want to grow your product, you need a blog that can be good for: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Motivated developers who wish to learn more about you. </p></li>
<li><p>Developers who are doing research about a problem and want to find a solution (SEO). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t like to discuss other benefits, such as credibility and education, that can be for another post. </p>

<p>Now that we have established the importance of a blog, why would you want to use an external blog for your content?</p>



<h2>
  
  
  Your external blog 📜
</h2>

<p>What if: </p>

<ul>
<li>People are not aware that they have a problem. (Product without market dominator, such as Novu). </li>
<li>SEO has a meager amount of traffic, and the competition is stiff. </li>
<li>You don’t have enough time to wait for long-term channels. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can use external blogs</strong>. They have a lot of mixed visitors who scour their platform daily and might be interested in what you offer.<br>
Those platforms work in the <strong>“marketplace”</strong> mode, where they promote interesting and trending articles. </p>

<p>Nothing stops you from posting your article on your website blog and then posting your articles to all the other platforms with a <strong>canonical link</strong> back to your website. I used a <strong>freelancer on Upwork</strong> for a few dollars to post my articles on DEV, Hashnode, Hacknoon, and Medium whenever I have a new article. </p>

<p>And for the question, “<strong>What platform should I post on?</strong>” The answer is: all of them.</p>



<h2>
  
  
  Traffic to launch 🚀
</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, the biggest question is, <strong>“What platform should I launch on?”</strong><br>
When you launch something, you send every possible traffic you currently have: Social Media, Newsletter, etc. to the platform of your choice. Your main goal is that the platform will reward you with the traffic you send. Here are my thoughts about the different platforms: </p>



<h3>
  
  
  Medium
</h3>

<p><a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is a generalized platform, and it has the most significant amount of audience for developers. If you managed to trend on Medium, you might get tens of thousands of developers reading your content. But it’s hard.</p>

<p>If you are starting, here is what I would do: </p>

<p>I would not put my launch on Medium. I will post my articles there regularly, and after a while, some publications will contact you and give you the ability to publish the post on their feed. Use it, and always post on their feed. I play with my publications between <a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io">Javascript in plain English</a>, <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io">Bits and Pieces</a>, and <a href="https://blog.devgenius.io">Dev Genius</a>. After a while, your audience on Medium will grow, you will get more followers exposed to your new articles, and your initial traffic can significantly increase. </p>

<p>Here is a trick I really liked from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielweinberger">Ariel Weinberger</a>, founder of <a href="https://pezzo.ai">Pezzo</a>. </p>

<p>Ariel has the most extensive Udemy course about NestJS. When he has a NestJS-related article, he sends people to the article on Medium and gets thousands of likes. And you can do the same with different traffic sources you have. </p>

<p>Once you have a vast audience, you can feel comfortable to launch on Medium. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M9qFcGo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yoho3pqklg5so40fktv4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M9qFcGo0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yoho3pqklg5so40fktv4.png" alt="Medium" width="800" height="452"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  DEV
</h3>

<p><a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a> is my favorite platform to launch; getting your article trending there requires meager traffic. Their algorithm is still young, so you can quickly bring enough traffic and likes to the platform to be on the top feed. </p>

<p>I had articles there reaching 100k views with a minimal amount of marketing. </p>

<p>The platform consists mainly of juniors and Javascript developers. You acquire an audience fast there; I have more than 11k followers in one year. </p>

<p>I feel like the platform has started getting less traffic than in the past.<br>
It’s good enough for now, but let’s see what happens next year. </p>

<p>I am a big advocate for DEV, and <a href="https://github20k.com/blog">my blog</a> contains many tricks to get your articles trending there. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cN2TiDxu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wx0v1qov6tjio8b1kyyn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cN2TiDxu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wx0v1qov6tjio8b1kyyn.png" alt="DEV" width="800" height="400"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  Hashnode
</h3>

<p><a href="https://hashnode.com">Hashnode</a> is an interesting platform. It’s a blog that consists of many blogs. And on the main, there is a “Featured” section for trending articles. </p>

<p>I think DEV made a better approach since when I go to somebody's article on DEV, I stay on the DEV website so that I might be exposed to other people's articles. On Hashnode, you remain in the personal blog, so the traffic is not circulating. As a result, I feel that Hashnode has much less traffic than DEV. </p>

<p>I was featured on Hashnode multiple times and got little traffic. </p>

<p>What I do feel is that </p>

<p>They get new features rapidly outside compared to DEV </p>

<p>The owner of the platforms is very active daily there and helps articles out. </p>

<p>I think there will be a significant change there in the coming years. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uiyxwLZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27u2o6izsez079pe8pv4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--uiyxwLZi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/27u2o6izsez079pe8pv4.png" alt="Hashnode" width="800" height="430"></a></p>



<h3>
  
  
  Hackernoon
</h3>

<p><a href="https://hackernoon.com">Hackernoon</a> it’s the weirdest platform of all of them in terms of design. You can post articles. You have to “Submit” them. They also charge companies to post. I had one piece there, and the results were “meh” compared to posting on DEV. The platform itself is super complicated, and the UX is awful. I don’t even post there regularly. </p>

<p>I might lack information about this platform as I am not motivated to explore it deeply. Do you think you know better what to do with it? Let me know.</p>

 #### - [Node.js Unveiled: The Inner Workings of a Runtime Revolution](https://dev.to/hakan_turan/nodejs-unveiled-the-inner-workings-of-a-runtime-revolution-agf) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Node.js has been a game-changer in the world of web development, breaking down the barriers between client and server-side programming. But have you ever wondered how Node.js actually works under the hood? This article aims to demystify the inner workings of Node.js, offering a comprehensive look at its architecture, event-driven model, and much more. Buckle up for an exciting journey into the heart of Node.js!</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Node.js?
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Before diving into the nitty-gritty, let's establish what Node.js is. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js has enabled JavaScript to expand beyond the browser, powering back-end development, APIs, and even desktop applications.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  The V8 Engine
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>The V8 engine is the powerhouse behind Node.js. Developed by Google, V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code, making it incredibly fast. But Node.js is not just V8. It extends the capabilities of the engine by providing additional modules and features that are not available in the browser environment, such as file system access and networking.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Event Loop: Node.js' Beating Heart
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Node.js adopts an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. The Event Loop is the core of this model. If you've ever wondered how Node.js can handle multiple tasks simultaneously despite being single-threaded, the Event Loop is your answer.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  How the Event Loop Works
</h3>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Initial Code Execution</strong>: When a Node.js application starts, the main module's code is executed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Asynchronous Calls</strong>: Node.js offloads asynchronous operations like file reading or network requests to separate threads, freeing up the main thread.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Callback Queue</strong>: Once an asynchronous operation is complete, its callback function is pushed into a queue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Event Loop</strong>: The Event Loop continuously checks if the main thread is free. If it is, it dequeues a callback from the queue and executes it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Modules and NPM
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Node.js introduced the CommonJS module system, allowing developers to include various modules in their applications. The Node Package Manager (NPM) is another cornerstone, providing a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Core Modules
</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Node.js comes with several built-in modules, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>fs</code> for file system operations</li>
<li>
<code>http</code> for HTTP requests and responses</li>
<li>
<code>crypto</code> for cryptography functions</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Third-Party Modules
</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>NPM allows you to install third-party modules to extend your application's capabilities. Popular modules include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>express</code> for web application framework</li>
<li>
<code>mongoose</code> for MongoDB object modeling</li>
<li>
<code>socket.io</code> for real-time communication</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Streams and Buffers
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Node.js is designed to handle large files and data streams efficiently. Buffers temporarily hold data, while streams allow you to read from or write to a data source incrementally, reducing memory usage.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Types of Streams
</h3>

<p> </p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Readable Streams</strong>: For reading data (e.g., reading a file).</li>
<li>
<strong>Writable Streams</strong>: For writing data (e.g., creating a file).</li>
<li>
<strong>Duplex Streams</strong>: Both readable and writable (e.g., TCP sockets).</li>
<li>
<strong>Transform Streams</strong>: Duplex streams that modify data as it's read or written (e.g., compression).</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Real-world Applications
</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Node.js is incredibly versatile, powering a range of applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Web Servers</strong>: With frameworks like Express.js, Node.js is a popular choice for building web servers.</li>
<li>
<strong>APIs</strong>: Node.js excels at handling I/O-bound operations, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Real-time Applications</strong>: With WebSockets and libraries like Socket.io, Node.js is perfect for real-time applications like chat apps and online gaming.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Case Studies
</h2>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Netflix
</h3>

<p>Netflix switched some of its components to Node.js for better performance and reduced build times. They experienced up to a 70% reduction in startup time.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  LinkedIn
</h3>

<p>LinkedIn moved its mobile backend to Node.js, resulting in a 20x faster server and significantly reduced resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

 #### - [How to Improve Front-end performance??🤔](https://dev.to/manish7107/how-to-improve-front-end-performance-3ag7) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Improving front-end performance is crucial for creating fast and responsive web applications. Here are some tips to help you enhance the performance of your front-end code:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Images and Media:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, SVG) for different types of images.</li>
<li>Compress images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality.</li>
<li>Lazy load images to only load them when they are in the viewport.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize HTTP Requests:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the number of requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files, using sprite sheets, and avoiding excessive use of external resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilize Browser Caching:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set appropriate cache headers to allow the browser to store resources locally. This reduces the need for repeated downloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minify and Bundle Files:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to remove unnecessary characters like whitespace, comments, and newline characters.</li>
<li>Bundle multiple smaller files into a single, larger file to reduce the number of HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Critical Rendering Path:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Prioritize the loading of critical resources needed for initial rendering (e.g., inline critical CSS, preload resources).</li>
<li>Avoid render-blocking resources in the head section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Leverage CDNs to distribute static resources across multiple servers, reducing server load and improving load times for users globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose Efficient CSS Selectors:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using complex selectors or over-qualified selectors. Specificity can slow down rendering times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize CSS and JavaScript Performance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid unnecessary animations and transitions, as they can hinder performance.</li>
<li>Use asynchronous and deferred loading for non-critical scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement Responsive Web Design:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use CSS media queries to ensure your website is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Render-Blocking Scripts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Load non-essential scripts after the initial rendering or use techniques like <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Fonts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use system fonts or a small set of web-safe fonts to reduce font loading times.</li>
<li>Consider using font-display CSS property to control how fonts are displayed while they are still loading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor and Analyze Performance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use tools like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and browser developer tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize JavaScript Execution:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid unnecessary calculations and DOM manipulations, especially in loops.</li>
<li>Use efficient algorithms and data structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce DOM Manipulations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minimize the frequency of DOM updates and try to batch them when possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For content-heavy sites, consider generating HTML on the server or at build time to reduce client-side rendering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember to test your website's performance on various devices and network conditions to ensure a smooth experience for all users. Additionally, regularly monitor and address performance issues as your application evolves.</p>
