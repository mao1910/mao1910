 #### - [Microservices: Unleashing the Power of Modular Software Architecture](https://dev.to/documatic/microservices-unleashing-the-power-of-modular-software-architecture-23h6) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h1>
  
  
  Introduction
</h1>

<p>We are in a generation where technology is evolving every day and it impacts the user expectation. It also leads to change in the way we design, build, and deploy any software application. We are currently moving towards the microservices architecture when comes to building applications. It is a driving force in modern software development.</p>

<p>Today monolithic applications are fewer in number as they try to encompass every feature, module, and component under a single codebase. As it hider the modern software development requirements and agility to keep up the pace with the evolving technology. The challenges are also related to the scalability of the software as you can not make changes to specific components independently. That‚Äôs why the Microservice architecture is gaining more popularity.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn more about the landscape of microservice architecture. We are going to look into the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is Microservices architecture?</li>
<li>Benefits of Using Microservices</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  What is Microservice Architecture?
</h1>

<p>It is an approach to designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. In this, every service can perform different functionality. Each service can be designed, built, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. </p>

<p>The below diagram shows you the working architecture of microservices.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33cTLT4g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt2wekbvm28gpwcdudrw.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33cTLT4g--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt2wekbvm28gpwcdudrw.png" alt="Architecture of Microservie" width="800" height="450"></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram, the communication between each component is done with API. </p>

<p>There are many major tech giants that use microservices to build their applications. Here are some of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Amazon</strong>: They use microservices to build their services including Amazon Marketplace, Prime, and Web Services. This helps them rapidly innovate and make changes as per requirements faster.</li>
<li>
<strong>Netflix</strong>: It uses microservices in aspects such as streaming services, such as user recommendations, video streaming, billing, and content management.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paypal</strong>: It adopts microservices to enhance its payment processing, fraud detection, and user management systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>LinkedIn</strong>: It uses microservers to handle user connections, profile management, content delivery, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spotify</strong>: A major audio streaming site uses microservices to deliver personalized music recommendations, playlist management, and seamless playback across devices.</li>
</ul>

<h1>
  
  
  Key principle of Microservices
</h1>

<p>Let‚Äôs learn about some of the key principles of microservices architecture. It is essential to understand those principles for perfect implementation. There are various principles among them some are:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
</h3>

<p>Since microservices emphasize modularity, the Single Responsibility Principle is used to define each service as having a single, well-defined functionality. It helps promote modular design and maintains clear boundaries between services.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Decentralized Data Management
</h3>

<p>Each service manages its own data store. It prevents tight coupling between services. Services can have their own database or it can be shared across different databases. It is not strictly defined to use a separate database for each service. As each service manages each data store, it allows data autonomy and reduces the risk of data inconsistencies.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  API First Design
</h3>

<p>As the API is the core for the communication between each component in this architecture, it is believed to be designed first. Microservices emphasize the importance of developing the API first. It helps in clear communication between each component. It also helps in compatibility.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Scalability
</h3>

<p>Scalability simply means the capacity of the system to handle increased workload, traffic, or data without a bottleneck in the performance. Microservices enable horizontal scaling. In horizontal Scaling, we add more machines and serve to distribute the load. Thus providing each service to be scaled independently based on demand. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Design for Failure
</h3>

<p>This architecture preassumes that failure will occur in the system at some point. Thus it is designed to handle failure. Services can degrade without impacting the entire system.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Benefits of Using Microservices
</h1>

<p>There are various benefits that you can get by using the microservice architecture. Here are some of them:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Modularity and Scalability
</h3>

<p>By using microservice architecture, you will be breaking down complex codebases into smaller and manageable components. Thus each component can be handled separately with its Software development life cycle. It allows scalability as you don‚Äôt need to make changes to the entire codebase when making changes to one component. Each component can be built, designed, deployed, and scaled separately.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Rapid Development
</h3>

<p>As each component can be built and deployed separately, we can run tests separately too. This will make the development cycles faster. It also becomes faster to provide updates to the application as you will need to make a few changes.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Technology Heterogeneity
</h3>

<p>Mircorservice allows you to build each component separately which means you can use different programming languages, frameworks, and stacks for different services. You can use the most efficient language and tool for that particular service. Otherwise, you can have to stick to that framework and language for the whole codebase.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Team Autonomy
</h3>

<p>Due to different features being shipped through different services, you can divide the team to work on that particular service. It will give autonomy to the team and you can develop applications in parallel. This will result in faster iteration and more efficient collaboration between teams. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Agility and Adaptability
</h3>

<p>Using microservices architecture, we can develop our application to be more agile. Meaning that it becomes easy to make changes to the application as per the client/user requirement changes. </p>

<h1>
  
  
  Limitation of Microservices
</h1>

<p>Everything comes with pros and cons. Microservices are no exception. Let‚Äôs look into some of them:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Complexity of Distributed Systems
</h3>

<p>Since there are separate services for each functionality, it can be very complex to manage each service. This can cause problems such as inter-service communication, data inconsistency, and fault tolerance.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Increase Operational Overhead
</h3>

<p>Building, deploying, and managing different services required sophisticated management tools. As there will be a number of services, it will increase the management cost. It can eventually lead to an increase in the operational cost of the whole project. </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Data Management Challenges
</h3>

<p>As there will be a database connecting to each service, it can increase the complexity of managing the database. Maintaining data integrity in a distributed environment requires careful design and implementation.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Communication Challenges
</h3>

<p>Communication between each service and database is a crucial part of the microservices. They are communicated over a network. It can cause overload in the network and eventually cause network latency. Also, as the API is the key for the communication, it should be secured. It can ensure data privacy across services.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h1>

<p>The ever-evolving technologies have led to monolithic architecture being inadequate with the invocations. It has limitations such as scalability, agility, and flexibility. Due to this, microservices architecture is gaining popularity. It can provide a better option when comes to scalability.</p>

<p>As we have seen in the article, microservices architecture can improve the application by providing modularity, agility, and rapid development. It can help large applications to be better at handling each service. However, both microservices and monolithic will exist as there are also some limitations such as communication and complexity challenges in microservices.</p>

<p>I hope this article has helped you in learning the microservices architecture. Thanks for reading the article.</p>

<p>Identify your top competitors- The Organic Research Competitors report provides a complete list of established companies and new entrants. To measure how competitive one domain is compared to another, there is a parameter called the Competition level. </p>

<p>This enables you to get an idea of how much competition exists between the two domains. The competition level between you and your rivals is determined by two glaring factors - the number of ranked key phrases they possess and how many overlap yours.</p>

<p>Choose a backlink analysis tool- various backlink analysis tools exist in the market. However, depending on the type of business, choosing the one that suits your requirements is necessary. </p>

<p>Please do thorough market research on some of the best backlink analysis tools we have provided above and select the one you need.</p>

<p>Analyze competitors' backlink profiles- Now that you better understand your backlink situation, it's time to start looking for areas to improve. A great place to start is by assessing the most successful pages and identifying how to replicate their success.</p>

<p>Identify the types of content that generate the most links from high-value sources to create additional content of this kind. Keep your eyes peeled for chances to create content other websites might link to. You can contact them so they know your linkable assets and link back to you. </p>

<p>Regarding do-follow and no-follow links, knowing the exact amount of each is essential. Do-follow links are beneficial for your backlink profile as they pass on link juice, while no-follow links don't do that.</p>

<p>Find content gaps and link- Conducting a content gap analysis is an essential strategy if you want to improve the content of your website. You can make sure that your website performs better than the competition and precisely matches with your business objectives by carefully evaluating and optimizing the material that is already there. By using an analytical approach, you can spot holes in your present content strategy and deliberately plug them for the most impact. </p>

<p>For instance, consider the case of an SEO agency that has a large number of blog posts on cutting-edge SEO strategies. However, you see that users are leaving your pages far too frequently and hastily. A short study of the content gaps may help to clarify the issue by analyzing how interesting your content is.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, you must locate and fill any content gaps immediately. The Backlink Gap tool and the Overview report in the Backlink Analytics tool are two practical options for analyzing your backlink profiles. They allow you to measure the performance of 5 different domains simultaneously. </p>

<p>Broken links are hyperlinks that no longer connect to their intended destination. They can occur when a website or webpage is moved, deleted, or its URL is changed. Fixing broken links is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and ensuring that visitors can access the content they are seeking on a website. With the best backlink analysis tools, broken links, and content gaps can be located and fixed.</p>

<p>Monitor competitors' backlink activities over time- Although not required, we strongly urge you to conduct a competition study because it might show potential gaps in the content market. This will provide you with details about the following:</p>

<p>Quick Hacks for Finding Competitors' Backlinks<br>
Examining your competition's backlinks is a highly effective method for creating a link-building strategy. Here are some quick hacks on how to find competitors' backlinks:<br>

This not only enhances your website's authority and credibility but also boosts its overall visibility and online presence.<br><br>
Spy on competitors' guest posting activities- You should start by pulling out your competitors backlink profile via Semrush, and Ahrefs. Using Spyfy, you can type in your website and click on the 'Competitors' tab to get a list of related websites.

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In today's digital era, eCommerce has become an integral part of our lives, and mobile apps have emerged as a key platform for online shopping. With the increasing demand for convenient and personalized shopping experiences, creating an eCommerce app is considered as a profitable strategy.

In this blog post, we will guide you through the essential steps and strategies to develop an eCommerce app that stands out in this highly competitive market.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Create a Successful eCommerce Application</strong></p>

<p><strong>Define Your Target Audience</strong></p>

Conduct market research, analyze user demographics, and gather insights to tailor your app accordingly. Consider factors such as age, location, interests, and shopping habits to create a personalized experience for your users.</p>

<p><strong>Determine User Experience (UX) Design</strong><br>
The user experience plays a vital role in the success of an eCommerce app. Aim for a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing design that focuses on ease of navigation, efficient product search, and seamless checkout process. Your hired eCommerce app development company will implement responsive design principles to ensure your app functions well across various devices and screen sizes, providing a consistent experience.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare Product Catalog</strong><br>
Organize your product catalog in a logical and user-friendly manner. Use categories, filters, and search functionalities to help users find products quickly and effortlessly. Display high-quality product images, detailed descriptions, customer reviews, and ratings to build trust and aid purchase decisions. Also checkout <a href="https://successive.tech/blog/ecommerce-app-development-guide/">eCommerce App Development Guide</a> to understanding product catalog.</p>

Conduct rigorous testing across different devices and network conditions to ensure your app performs well under varying circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Integration</strong><br>
Leverage the power of social media by integrating sharing options and enabling user-generated content. Allow users to share their favorite products, reviews, or purchases on social platforms. Incorporate social login options to streamline the registration process and increase user convenience.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Improvement and Feedback</strong><br>
Analyze user feedback, ratings, and reviews to identify areas for improvement. Regularly update your app with new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. Engage with your user community through surveys, ratings prompts, and customer support channels to build a loyal user base.</p>

 #### - [How is it to build something in public?](https://dev.to/azasypkin/how-is-it-to-build-something-in-public-3m3j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <blockquote>
<p>The original post was published on my blog on <strong>July 20, 2023</strong>, long before I realized it might be interesting to the dev.to community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It‚Äôs a hard, but rewarding experience!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been two months since I opened up <a href="https://secutils.dev/"><strong>Secutils.dev</strong></a> for an open beta and started writing about my indie hacking journey in public for the first time while still being a full-time employee at Elastic. In this short post, I just want to reflect on how things are going, what was good, and what wasn‚Äôt as good as I wanted it to be. If you‚Äôre in a similar situation or just curious, read on!</p>

<p>First of all, here are some stats from the last two months:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>102</strong> commits with fixes, enhancements, documentation, and features <a href="https://github.com/secutils-dev"><strong>across all Secutils.dev GitHub repositories</strong></a> </li>
<li>
<strong>18</strong> <a href="https://secutils.dev/docs/blog/"><strong>blog posts</strong></a> and the same amount of accompanying LinkedIn posts, <a href="https://twitter.com/aleh_zasypkin"><strong>tweets</strong></a>, and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@azasypkin"><strong>Mastodon posts</strong></a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>3</strong> one-on-one user interviews conducted (too few, I know I know, but hey, I‚Äôm still learning)</li>
<li>
<strong>1</strong> big feature delivered (<a href="https://github.com/secutils-dev/secutils/issues/14"><strong>Resource Tracker</strong></a>, going to cut a new release next week)</li>
</ul>

<p>I admit that the stats don‚Äôt look super impressive, but I really enjoyed the ride so far! It‚Äôs hard to describe the satisfaction I get from talking to the users of something I‚Äôve built from scratch and control every bit and piece of it ‚Äì one of the most rewarding experiences in my whole 15-year career, for sure.</p>

<p>As you can see from the stats, old habits die hard ‚Äì engineering still takes most of my time, and I didn‚Äôt spend enough time promoting Secutils.dev among the relevant communities and interacting with current and potential users. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôm going to fix.</p>

<p>The most important lesson I‚Äôve learned during these two months? It‚Äôs hard to find enough time and energy for a side-project like Secutils.dev while having a relatively intense full-time job, and <a href="https://secutils.dev/docs/blog/time-management"><strong>very aggressive prioritization and subtraction</strong></a> isn‚Äôt just an option, it‚Äôs a necessity. Nobody said it was going to be easy, though. On the bright side, life isn‚Äôt discrete ‚Äì everything I learn while pushing Secutils.dev forward perfectly applies to my full-time job, benefiting Elastic and my career, and vice versa, of course. Having a serious side gig like that, in my opinion, is one of the most effective ways to grow not only professionally but also as a resilient person.</p>

<p>That wraps up today's post, thanks for taking the time to read it!</p>
