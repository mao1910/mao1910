 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Overview
</h2>

<p>This is a companion blog post to support the video on a way to integrate <a href="https://payloadcms.com/">Payload CMS</a> SignIn, SignOut and Create Account in a Nuxt JS Application. </p>

<p><strong><em>This video assumes that you already have a Payload CMS server running. <a href="https://youtu.be/TDd9EedIrGY">See Part One of my Payload CMS video series</a> to see the server that the Nuxt Application in this video is interacting with.</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Payload CMS - The best way to build a modern backend + admin UI. No black magic, all TypeScript, and fully open-source, Payload is both an app framework and a headless CMS. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://payloadcms.com/">https://payloadcms.com/</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It includes the code for the necessary pages and the custom plugin for connecting with Payload CMS to get current user and manage the user information; and the middleware for controlling access to application pages</p>

<span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  The Code
</h2>

<p>I have included the main files that need to be modified to get the application running after you delete the <code>App.vue</code> file</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The plugin
</h3>

<p>The main event here is the custom <a href="https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins">Nuxt Plugin</a>, I have written a custom plugin in Nuxt and set it so that it will be the first one run by starting the name with <code>01</code>.</p>

<p>The plugin checks for a user using the Payload CMS endpoint <code>customers/me</code> to check for a user; the user will be returned if one exists, otherwise null is returned.</p>

<p>The plugin then stores the user information and the authentication information in state variables using the <a href="https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-state#usestate">Nuxt useState</a> function.</p>

<p>There are also two additional functions added to the plugin</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>updateUser</code> sets the current user information after a successful login</li>
<li>
<code>clearUsers</code> clears the user information and the authentication information after the user logs out</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>As I stated in the video, refactoring the plugin to include the <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> functions will make these two functions unnecessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
  
  
  The Middleware
</h3>

<p>The middleware <code>auth.ts</code> has a single purpose which is to redirect the user to the login page.</p>

<p>It works by accessing the plugin using the <a href="https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-nuxt-app#usenuxtapp"><code>useNuxtApp</code></a> hook to access the <code>$payloadAuth</code> plugin we discussed above.<br>

<h3>
  
  
  The Login Page
</h3>

<p>The login page uses <a href="https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started">NuxtUI</a> to make things look nice, but there is also some verification functionality provided by NuxtUI that we use to make sure we are provided an <code>email</code> and <code>password</code> value to use with the Payload CMS API call.</p>

<p>Important to notice how we access the plugin after a successful login to update the user information in the plugin with the information from the currently authenticated user by calling <code>$payloadAuth.updateUser()</code><br>

<h2>
  
  
  The emergence of AI in software testing
</h2>

<p>In recent years, there's been a game-changing development in the world of software testing: the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has been shaking up various industries, and software testing is right there in the mix. AI brings with it a powerful toolkit and a bag of tricks that can seriously level up the way we do testing.</p>

<p>You see, the traditional methods of testing often rely on humans putting in the hours, and that can mean things get a bit slow, expensive, and sometimes mistakes happen. But AI? It's a different story. It can take care of a bunch of testing tasks all on its own, and it does it quicker and with more precision. It can create test cases, spot tricky code patterns, and even predict problems before they become real headaches.</p>

<p>The cool thing is, AI-powered testing doesn't just speed things up; it also frees up human testers to focus on the more intricate and imaginative parts of their work. That's how it ultimately raises the bar for software quality.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Traditional Challenges of Software Testing
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Manual testing limitations
</h3>

<p>Traditional software testing has long relied on manual processes, which, while essential, come with their own set of limitations. Manual testing involves human testers meticulously executing test cases, observing software behavior, and documenting the results. While this approach ensures a human touch and the ability to assess the user experience, it can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. </p>

<p>Human testers may overlook certain scenarios or make subjective judgments that can lead to inconsistent results. Additionally, as software complexity grows, so does the need for an extensive suite of test cases, making it increasingly challenging to cover all possible scenarios manually. These limitations highlight the necessity for more efficient testing methods.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Test automation and its challenges
</h3>

<p>To overcome the limitations of doing testing manually, we turned to something called test automation. This basically means using special software tools and scripts to run tests automatically, instead of having people do it all by hand.</p>

<p>Now, automation can be a real game-changer. It speeds up the testing process and makes it more consistent. But, like anything good, it comes with its own share of challenges. Creating and keeping up these automated test scripts can eat up a lot of time and requires some technical know-how. Plus, not all types of testing, like the kind where you check how user-friendly a software is or when you go on an exploration to find hidden bugs, can easily be automated.</p>

<p>Another hiccup is when the software being tested changes quickly. These scripts need to be updated constantly to keep up with the changes, which can be a bit of a hassle. So, in the world of modern software testing, it's all about finding the right balance between the perks of automation and these challenges it brings.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The need for more efficient and effective testing methods
</h3>

<p>As software development practices continue to evolve, the need for more efficient and effective testing methods becomes increasingly evident. Businesses and users demand faster software releases without compromising quality. This requires innovative approaches to testing that can keep pace with agile development cycles. </p>

<p>Traditional testing methods often struggle to meet these demands. There is a growing realization that testing should not be viewed as a separate phase at the end of development but integrated throughout the entire software development lifecycle. This shift in mindset, coupled with advancements in technology, has paved the way for the integration of AI in testing, promising a more efficient and effective way to ensure software quality. </p>

  Features of AI-Powered Tools
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Machine learning algorithms for test case generation
</h3>

<p>The inclusion of AI in software testing has brought about a fresh era in the generation of test cases. We're now using machine learning algorithms to craft test cases in a smarter and more dynamic way. This approach comes with two major advantages:</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Test data generation
</h4>

<p>Machine learning can assist in generating diverse and relevant test data. By analyzing historical data and application behavior, AI algorithms can create test data that covers a wide range of scenarios. This ensures that the software is thoroughly tested under various conditions, helping to identify potential issues that might otherwise remain hidden.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Test script generation
</h4>

<p>AI-driven tools can automate the generation of test scripts, saving testers valuable time. These tools analyze the application's user interface and behavior to automatically create test scripts that mimic user interactions. This not only speeds up the testing process but also reduces the likelihood of scripting errors, enhancing the reliability of test cases.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Predictive analytics for defect identification
</h3>

<p>AI's predictive capabilities are instrumental in identifying defects more effectively:</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Early defect detection
</h4>

<p>Machine learning models can analyze historical defect data and software metrics to predict areas of the code that are more likely to contain defects. This enables testers to prioritize testing efforts and focus on the most critical parts of the application, improving efficiency and defect detection rates.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Root cause analysis
</h4>

<p>When defects are detected, AI can assist in pinpointing their root causes. By analyzing test results and application logs, AI-powered tools can identify the specific lines of code or modules responsible for defects. This not only accelerates the debugging process but also helps developers address issues more efficiently.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Automated test execution and monitoring
</h3>

<p>AI is transforming the way tests are executed and monitored:</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Continuous integration and continuous testing
</h4>

<p>AI-enabled testing tools seamlessly integrate with the software development process, supporting the concept of continuous integration and continuous testing (CI/CT). This means that tests can be automatically triggered whenever new code is committed, ensuring that changes are tested immediately. AI can also prioritize and rerun tests based on code changes, optimizing the testing pipeline.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  Real-time monitoring of application behavior
</h4>

<p>AI-based monitoring tools can continuously observe the behavior of the application in real time. They can detect anomalies, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities as they occur, allowing for proactive intervention. This real-time feedback loop enables teams to address issues promptly, reducing downtime and enhancing user experience.</p>

<p>Incorporating AI-powered testing tools and techniques into the software development process holds the promise of not only improving testing efficiency but also elevating the overall quality of software products. These advanced capabilities enable software teams to respond to the ever-increasing demands for faster and more reliable software releases in today's competitive landscape.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Benefits of AI in Software Testing
</h2>

<p>Here are the main benefits of using AI for software testing:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Wider Test Coverage
</h3>

<p>One of the standout advantages of incorporating AI into software testing is the substantial improvement in test coverage and accuracy. Traditional manual testing methods often struggle to cover all possible scenarios due to time constraints and human limitations. However, AI-driven testing tools excel in this aspect. </p>

<p>Machine learning algorithms can automatically generate a vast array of test cases, exploring different paths and inputs within the software. This comprehensive test coverage ensures that even edge cases and uncommon scenarios are examined, reducing the risk of critical issues going undetected. Moreover, AI's ability to replicate test cases precisely means that tests are executed with a high degree of accuracy, minimizing false positives and negatives in defect identification.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Faster Testing Cycles
</h3>

<p>AI-driven testing tools turbocharge the testing process, making it much quicker. When we let AI handle test automation, it can run tests way faster than humans can ever dream of. Plus, AI is pretty smart at figuring out which tests really matter based on the changes in the code. This means we can give developers feedback much more quickly.</p>

<p>The end result? Testing time shrinks dramatically, and that means software teams can roll out updates and new features in record time. In today's fast-paced world of software development, being able to cut down testing cycles like this is a game-changer that helps businesses stay ahead of the competition.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Reduced Manual Effort
</h3>

<p>AI in software testing brings a significant drop in the amount of manual work required. Things that used to eat up a lot of time and were pretty repetitive, like creating test cases, getting data ready, and keeping test scripts up to date, can now be done automatically with AI-powered tools.</p>

<p>This means testers can spend their time on more interesting and exploratory testing tasks where human judgment and gut feeling really count. This shift not only makes us more productive but also lowers the chance of human mistakes because automated processes are super reliable and accurate.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Enhanced Defect Detection
</h3>

<p>AI's predictive analytics skills are a big deal when it comes to spotting and stopping defects in their tracks. It does this by looking at past data and software stats to figure out which parts of the code are likely to have issues. This way, testers can put their effort where it matters most.</p>

<p>Finding problems early on means we catch and fix them when they're still small, which saves us a lot of time and trouble down the road. Plus, AI keeps an eye on things in real-time, so it can spot anything weird happening with the software's performance as it's happening. This lets us step in and fix potential problems before they get to the users.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Machine Learning Over Time
</h3>

<p>Over the course of its evolution, Artificial Intelligence (AI) undergoes a transformative process in the realm of software testing, primarily driven by the principles of machine learning. This progression is marked by its ability to continually enhance the efficiency and efficacy of test cases, a dynamic journey where AI continually refines its capabilities.</p>

<p>As the AI matures, its machine learning algorithms become more sophisticated, honing their ability to differentiate between routine and exceptional situations within the software. This, in turn, equips the AI with the invaluable capability to proactively seek out areas of the software that require rigorous testing, thereby significantly enhancing the test coverage.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Challenges and Considerations
</h2>

<p>Here are some key challenges and considerations when adopting AI for software testing:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Data Privacy and Security
</h3>

<p>Even though AI-powered testing brings a bunch of advantages, it brings its own set of tricky issues, and one of the big ones is all about data privacy and security. See, AI algorithms often need a whole bunch of data to do their thing ‚Äì stuff like test data, info about past problems, and logs from the software.</p>

<p>The hitch is that this data can sometimes have sensitive stuff in it, and if we don't handle it right, things can go really wrong. We've got to make sure that the data we use in AI-powered testing is kept safe and made anonymous so that nobody can just snoop around or accidentally spill the beans.</p>

<p>And, we've got to play by the rules, especially when it comes to data protection laws like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> or <a href="https://sprinto.com/blog/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA</a>. Breaking these rules can land us in hot water with hefty fines and damage our reputation. So, it's a constant juggling act to find the right balance between using data for AI-driven testing and keeping it all under wraps.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Skillset and Training
</h3>

<p>The successful implementation of AI in software testing necessitates a workforce equipped with the right skillset and training. AI-powered testing tools and techniques require testers and developers to have a solid understanding of AI concepts, machine learning algorithms, and the tools themselves. This means that organizations need to invest in training their teams or hiring individuals with the required expertise. </p>

<p>AI is a rapidly evolving field, and staying up-to-date with the latest advancements and best practices is crucial. Adapting to this changing landscape can be challenging but is essential for reaping the full benefits of AI in testing. Additionally, organizations must foster a culture of learning and experimentation to encourage innovation in the testing process.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Integration with Existing Processes
</h3>

<p>Adding AI-powered testing to the way we've always done things can get pretty complicated. Lots of organizations have their testing routines and tools all figured out, and tossing AI into the mix can mess things up if not done right. So, you've got to be smart about how you go about it to make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>

<p>First off, you've got to think about whether AI plays nice with the testing tools and systems you already have. And don't be surprised if some folks on your team aren't too keen on shaking things up; resistance to change is pretty common.</p>

<p>Also, it's a good idea to figure out which parts of testing are a good fit for AI and where humans still have to call the shots. It's all about finding the sweet spot between AI and human testing to make sure everything works as well as it can.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Wrapping up
</h2>

<p>In this blog, we've taken a deep dive into how AI is making a big impact on software testing. It's not just a fancy buzzword; it's changing the game when it comes to ensuring top-notch software quality. AI is like a powerful ally in this quest, and it's doing a lot of heavy lifting.</p>

<p>So, here's the bottom line: we think organizations should really give AI-driven testing a shot. It comes with some pretty clear benefits: better test coverage, faster testing, less manual labor, and sharper defect detection. But, it's important to go into this with your eyes open. You'll need to deal with issues like keeping data safe, getting your team up to speed, and fitting AI into your existing routines.</p>

<p>This isn't just about technology; it's a whole new way of doing things that values innovation and always getting better. By bringing AI into your software testing, you're not just delivering better software; you're also staying ahead in a world that's always changing.</p>

 #### - [Performance Testing: Why, When, and What](https://dev.to/cloudx/performance-testing-why-when-and-what-45k3) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Overview
</h2>

<p>When you have an application, regardless of whether it's in production or not, there comes a point when you need to perform performance testing. You might start by searching for various paid services, free tools that are rather difficult to understand, and concepts like load testing, spike testing, stress testing, and more.<br>
Let's try to clarify this matter and provide a useful walkthrough with a live example.<br>
If you have an API, performance can be divided into two sections: internal and external. Internal performance should evaluate memory allocation, the number of threads, disposed objects, etc. External performance is related, but it measures response time, the number of accepted requests, etc.<br>
Let's focus on the external performance for now.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The WHY
</h2>

<p>We perform performance testing for two main reasons, among others: verification and detection. For verification, we intend to check whether the application fulfills the expected demand, and for detection, we test to verify if the application breaks, and at what load. This latter test can be executed when the boundaries are not clear enough or to test the app's behavior outside the usage boundaries, usually above the maximum level. This is really useful when we are trying to prepare for eventual spikes or future increases in demand.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The WHEN
</h2>

<p>We perform performance testing once we know the expected usage of the app at the point of going into production. We run it before going into production and during production.<br>
However, we do not run it with every release, do we? This decision depends on various factors: the environment, your needs, the team you have to perform these tests, the criticality of the affected areas of that release, and the application itself.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The WHAT
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IzAx67sA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/wtf.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IzAx67sA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/wtf.jpg" alt="What" width="599" height="327"></a></p>

<p>This is the most crucial part. Location, location, location.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Before you start
</h3>

<p>Things you need to know BEFORE you start thinking about performance, and the first one is boundaries.<br>
What do we understand by boundaries? Well, boundaries are the limits your application will hit when running.</p>

<p>Going back to boundaries and regarding external testing of an API, what you need to know in advance is:<br>
    - How many requests per second are you expecting, both maximum and minimum?<br>
    - Are you expecting load peaks? How many? At what times? For how long?<br>
Without this information, then running performance tests makes less sense as you don't have a comparison point.</p>

<p>Nice, you got the info? Then it's time to start doing setups.<br>
Well, not there yet. First, you have to draft a plan.</p>

<h4>
  
  
  The plan
</h4>

<p>To draft a plan, you need to consider the types of performance testing and decide on your objectives.<br>
Most commonly, you can:<br>
    - Load test<br>
    - Spike testing<br>
    - Stress test<br>
    - Mixed<br>
Each strategy has its benefits and drawbacks, and this is tightly bound to what you want to test.</p>

<p>All of these are usually composed of the <strong>start-up</strong>, <strong>the load</strong>, and the <strong>tear-down</strong> phases.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The start-up
</h3>

<p>There are several ways to do this. You can use a step-up/down pattern, linear increase (even varying the steepness), or you could use exponential increase/decrease.</p>

<p>Step up in 4 phases<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K3DytGz8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/00-stepupplan.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K3DytGz8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/00-stepupplan.png" alt="The Plan" width="800" height="324"></a></p>

<p>Important things to note here:<br>
You have a target of virtual users; each one of them will run one or more requests based on your configuration and your needs. As you can see here, we are targeting 1000 virtual users, from 0 to 1000 in 16 minutes, and then holding for 30 minutes and tearing down again in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>In this case, we were testing for a breaking point, which we found at 500 virtual users. This is also called a Load test pattern, as the heaviest load will occur during sustained time, and we will test how the servers behave when load is held, besides the advantage it provides if you don't know your boundaries.</p>

<p>If you already know your limits, then you can plan differently like:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FS9ThIoT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/01-constantsteep.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FS9ThIoT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/01-constantsteep.png" alt="The Steep" width="800" height="339"></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the pattern is different, and it's targeting different results.<br>
The former one is increasing by steps so we can measure at different moments in time and also check for infrastructure changes and responses (pods warming up, memory allocation, processor, etc.)<br>
The latter one increases directly to the top, holds, and then decreases. Here, the target could be evaluating if we have memory leaks or if the processor can spawn multiple threads and so on. Numerous metrics can be evaluated, and it will depend on what you are looking for. I'm just mentioning the common ones.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The hold
</h3>

<p>At this stage is where you want to decide if you want to hold, for how much time, if you will have spikes, how many, how long? How steep?</p>

<p>For instance, the next image shows a holding pattern interrupted by a 4x peak.<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RS5YWeAo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/02-spike.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RS5YWeAo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/02-spike.png" alt="Spike" width="800" height="335"></a></p>

<p>At this point, we may want to check container warm-up, horizontal and vertical scaling, failure recovery, and so on, given that the spike increase is really fast; these are the common breaking points (network and scaling).</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Tear down
</h3>

<p>Once you have verified the behavior under load or spikes, it's time to let the services cool down, for the same reason that we stepped in; we want to do the tear down to check how the infrastructure is reacting. It could be memory analysis, how much and how fast it got cleared? How fast instances stopped? And etc‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Real-life config
</h2>

<p>Now, all of this is fine, but WHAT are we testing?? This, of course, varies according to your project. Let's begin by testing a specific endpoint, shall we?<br>
To test an endpoint is basically configuring the given tool to perform a GET/POST/PUT. In this case, I'm going to show how to run a GET to a specific API endpoint.</p>

<p>Let's use, for this purpose, jMeter.<br>
By default, JMeter has some tools to assemble a query such as thread groups, but there are also some cool plugins that we will be using:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Th2uLej7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/03-plugins.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Th2uLej7--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/03-plugins.png" alt="Plugins" width="800" height="599"></a></p>

<p>Start by installing the custom threads group that contains the Ultimate thread group. By using this plugin, you will be able to configure the steps you want and many other options.<br>
Second, add some graph generators of your choice.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, create a test plan and add an Ultimate thread group.<br>
The thread group should consist of the following components at a minimum:</p>

<ul>
<li>The HTTP Request

<ul>
<li>Then here, I'm adding input data from a CSV to send query parameters, a Header manager to send a basic auth token, and a throughput timer.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>Let's break it into pieces:

<ul>
<li>The HTTP request is pretty self-explanatory:</li>
<li>You have the name</li>
<li>Protocol</li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Path</li>
<li>Verb</li>
<li>And other parameters like port, etc.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>Then there are config elements, the first one is the CSV file input</li>
<li>Then the HTTP header manager

<ul>
<li>This is optional and also provides options for basic, JWT, and all the other headers you need to add.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>Third is the throughput. Here is where you also handle the load. It's not the same to have 1000 VU with 1000 requests per minute per user than having 1 request per second per VU.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see in the image:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OumWQTI0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/04-threadGroup.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OumWQTI0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/04-threadGroup.png" alt="ThreadGroup" width="380" height="98"></a></p>

<p>We are sending a maximum of 1 request per second per VU. The options here allow you to set an amount shared across all VUs or per VU, as seen in the image.<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dnw5XgT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/05-thoughput.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Dnw5XgT9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudx-labs/posts/main/posts/martinfernandezcx/assets/ART00-Performance/05-thoughput.png" alt="Throughput" width="800" height="133"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Wrapping up and information analysis

This is calculating the average time based on the number of VUs. As you can see in the image, it was averaging 22 seconds for a simple GET.</p>

Here, you'll notice two key points: the performance under constant throughput and the variance in 200 responses.<br>

<p>We can see that when reaching about 500 VU, the number of 502 and 504 errors started increasing.<br>
Further analysis revealed that our instances were not able to handle the load, and we determined that horizontal scaling combined with a small increase in resources on the actual pods would solve the problem, as you will see in the following image, that for the same pattern of load, the number of errors drastically reduced.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>When running performance analysis, it's really important to know what you will be looking for. Second, of course, is K.I.S.S. You don't need fancy graphics or complicated-to-configure tools, just go simple and straightforward.<br>
Then, make sure you capture all that's important to you and also compare it to the hardware metrics (not covered in this demo) so you can add graphs, logs, and hardware metrics to get a great combo and know what you need to improve.<br>
And last but not least, double-check and triple-check your findings. Running performance tests should be done in isolated environments, but if that is not possible, and you will target staging/UAT, make sure you have two or three runs at different times of the day so you can evaluate your results as well and compare.<br>
Hopefully, this post will aid you in running your first set of performance tests.</p>

<p>Good Luck.<br>
