 #### - [Elanat 2.1 released - .NET Honor!](https://dev.to/elanatframework/elanat-21-released-net-honor-2np9) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p><a href="https://elanat.net">Elanat</a> is a free and open-source CMS-Framework based on ASP.NET Core. <a href="https://github.com/elanatframework/Elanat">Elanat</a> was created to be a reliable system in .NET and an honor for .NET programmers and can be compared to other systems under PHP and JAVA.</p>

<p><strong>Elanat is .NET Honor!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O0YDcMTW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aa8ajgiil1319mg4jngo.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--O0YDcMTW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aa8ajgiil1319mg4jngo.png" alt="Elanat vs PHP and Java systems" width="800" height="139"></a></p>

<p>Elanat is a very large system; but you can manage it easily. It is even suitable for personal websites. There are nearly 600 executable aspx files, 56 DBMS tables, 560 stored procedures, more than 600 XML files and nearly 70 JavaScript files in Elanat core.</p>

<p>Elanat has a very modern architecture; in Elanat everything is add-on. Each add-on is a component and the component itself is also a component.</p>

<p>Elanat is a headless system; view is created by combining pages and templates. A new template can be assigned to each section (or url). Each page can be modified before execution.</p>

<p>Elanat has eight types of add-on; some of these add-ons are placed on different sections of pages. Pages are also add-ons.</p>

<p>Elanat supports all programming languages; Elanat is based on .NET Core, but supports all programming languages. You can create multiple add-ons for Elanat with any programming language.</p>

<p>Create add-on simply; Unlike other existing CMS, creating an add-on for Elanat is very simple. Just fill in a catalog file and create a zip file.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  CodeBehind
</h2>

<p>Elanat is created using the powerful CodeBehind framework; CodeBehind is a very powerful framework for .NET based on .NET Core version 7.0. Any new system that can support modules by using CodeBehind (is modular).The development structure with CodeBehind is based on the MVC pattern. CodeBehind inherits all the advantages of ASP.NET Core and adds great features to it.</p>

<p><strong>CodeBehind is .NET Diamond!</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E3pSNjb---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54bs9wftr5ui3hp38ldv.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--E3pSNjb---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/54bs9wftr5ui3hp38ldv.png" alt="CodeBehind is .NET Diamond" width="800" height="336"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Upgrate version 2.0.0.0
</h2>

<p>If you have installed the previous version of Elanat (2.0.0.0), you can upgrade Elanat to version 2.1.0.0 by entering the about component and clicking on the update button. Update with just one click!</p>

<p>Please note that when updating the Elanat framework to newer versions, we used advanced mechanisms so that the user who performs the update remains in the admin section and does not need to login again; But all the sessions will be deleted and the system will be restarted and every user who has logged in to the website will have to log in again. Therefore, our recommendation is to do the update in certain intervals when there are less active users on the website.</p>

<h2>

 #### - [SQLite vs. Chroma: A Comparative Analysis for Managing Vector Embeddings](https://dev.to/stephenc222/sqlite-vs-chroma-a-comparative-analysis-for-managing-vector-embeddings-4i76) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMWzOyml--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ep8ymhw8w126tbl97tul.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--mMWzOyml--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ep8ymhw8w126tbl97tul.jpg" alt="blog post main image comparing Chroma to SQLite for storing vector embeddings" width="720" height="480"></a></p>

<p>Vector embeddings play a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to understand and generate text with nuanced intelligence from your data.</p>

<p>However, managing these embeddings effectively requires a robust database.</p>

<p>Whether you‚Äôre navigating through well-known options like <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>, enriched with the <a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss">sqlite-vss</a> extension, or exploring other avenues like <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">Chroma</a>, an open-source vector database, selecting the right tool is paramount. This article compares these two choices, guiding you through the pros and cons of each, helping you choose the right tool for storing and querying vector embeddings for your project.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  SQLite with <code>sqlite-vss</code> Extension
</h2>

<p><code>sqlite-vss</code> extends SQLite databases with vector similarity search capabilities. It allows performing k-nearest neighbors searches on vector columns stored in SQLite tables, enabling use cases like semantic search, recommendations, and question answering.</p>

<p>My blog post <a href="https://stephencollins.tech/posts/how-to-use-sqLite-to-store-and-query-vector-embeddings">"How to use SQLite to store and query vector embeddings"</a> provides a tutorial on how to leverage SQLite to manage vector embeddings. The approach hinges on the <code>sqlite-vss</code> extension and TensorFlow's Universal Sentence Encoder for vector creation.</p>

<p>Let's talk about some advantages that SQLite with <code>sqlite-vss</code> has over Chroma:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  SQLite Advantages
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Privacy and Data Control</strong>: SQLite allows data to be stored locally, ensuring privacy and complete control over the data.</li>
<li>
<strong>Portability</strong>: Known for portability, SQLite's single-file database can be easily transferred or backed up, providing a convenient and compact solution for storing and moving vector embeddings.</li>
<li>
<strong>Simplicity</strong>: SQLite offers a straightforward, lightweight solution for developers familiar with SQL.</li>
</ol>

<p>SQLite however has some drawbacks in comparison to Chroma:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  SQLite Challenges
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Scalability</strong>: SQLite may not be the best fit for managing very large datasets or high-throughput applications.</li>
<li>
<strong>Complexity</strong>: Manual handling of vector storage and search logic might get complex with evolving requirements.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dependency</strong>: Relies on multiple dependencies (SQLite3, TensorFlow, TypeScript) which might be cumbersome to manage.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Chroma for Vector Embeddings
</h2>

<p>Chroma is an open-source embedding database, supported by the company of the same name, Chroma. You have the option to self-host it, and the company behind it has plans to offer hosted versions of Chroma in the near future.</p>

<p>I have also written about Chroma, <a href="https://stephencollins.tech/posts/how-to-use-chroma-to-store-and-query-vector-embeddings">"How to use Chroma to store and query vector embeddings"</a> that introduces you to Chroma, with a short guide on the process of integrating vector embeddings with it.</p>

<p>And here's some advantages that Chroma has over SQLite with <code>sqlite-vss</code>:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Chroma Advantages
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Dedicated Solution</strong>: Chroma is built specifically for managing vector embeddings, ensuring optimized storage and retrieval.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Chroma provides a simple interface for adding and querying documents without needing to manage the underlying complexity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scalability</strong>: Being a dedicated vector database, Chroma is designed to handle large-scale data and queries efficiently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally, some challenges as well:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Chroma Challenges
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>Setup Overhead</strong>: Running Chroma requires more infrastructure setup than SQLite, even with the future hosted version.</li>
<li>
<strong>Learning Curve</strong>: Developers unfamiliar with Chroma might require some time to get acquainted with its functionalities and setup.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Comparative Insights
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Ease and Flexibility vs. Specialization
</h3>

<p>SQLite with the <code>sqlite-vss</code> extension presents a solution that can be integrated into applications with relative ease, particularly those already using SQLite. However, Chroma, while potentially presenting a steeper learning curve, offers a specialized environment tailored to handle vector data, natively, and at a larger scale.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  2. Dependency Management
</h3>

<p>SQLite requires managing several dependencies and ensuring their compatibility, potentially making it less straightforward than Chroma in terms of dependency management, where most complexities are abstracted away within Docker containers. And this will further be true for Chroma once the hosted version is available.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Scalability and Performance
</h3>

<p>For projects that demand high performance and scalability, Chroma's dedicated nature might offer advantages over SQLite, potentially providing faster query times and more efficient storage for large-scale applications.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  4. Use Case Alignment
</h3>

<p>Developers might gravitate towards SQLite for smaller, lightweight projects or where embedding management is a small part of the application. In contrast, Chroma could be the go-to for applications heavily relying on semantic search or managing large collections of embeddings.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  5. Community and Support
</h3>

<p>Considering the community and support around these tools is also pivotal. While SQLite has a broad user base and extensive documentation, Chroma's niche focus on embedding management might offer more targeted resources and community expertise in this specific domain.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>Both SQLite with the <code>sqlite-vss</code> extension and Chroma offer viable pathways to managing vector embeddings, albeit with distinct advantages and potential challenges. Developers might opt for SQLite for its simplicity, familiarity, and fit for smaller-scale applications. Conversely, those dealing with extensive embedding data and requiring a dedicated, scalable solution might find Chroma to be a fitting choice.</p>

<p>In essence, the selection between SQLite and Chroma depends on aligning the tool with project requirements, scalability needs, and the team‚Äôs familiarity with the technology. As innovations in managing vector embeddings continue to evolve, exploring and understanding various tools like these will undeniably fortify developers‚Äô capabilities in building intelligent, semantically-aware applications.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for future posts, as I dive deeper into exploring and working with vector embeddings!</p>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Long rant: DO THEY BLOODY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT??</p>

<p>At this stage, it becomes non-trivial for anyone to walk into a conversation and notice the conversation starter has no idea what they want. </p>

<p>You ask them an extra "why" and they will stutter. You'd start questioning, "Can they think it through before all of this?"</p>

<p>It might be OK if it is just among your friends; after all, everyone has moments of confusion. But what if it is at work, in a meeting you have never anticipated? </p>

<p>Oh crap, challenging the meeting starter who happens to be your supervisor, boss, or even the boss of your boss? Engineers are expensive. We are expensive. Are we courageous enough to challenge our team lead? </p>

<p>I presume we all can silently agree that low-effective meetings bring more harm than benefits, both for organisation or for individuals. </p>

<p>After attending countless meetings, I think the value of meetings for an organisation lies in ensuring mutual agreements were established through real time communication and collaboration.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  However...
</h2>

<h2>
  
  
  The damages of low-effective meetings last
</h2>




<h3>
  
  
  The first problem: unnecessary meetings
</h3>

<p>When no one is bold enough to challenge the topic of a meeting, it brings the first problem -- unnecessary meetings. </p>

<p>We ought to ask ourselves, <strong>can we find a better solution without a meeting</strong>?  </p>

<p>Consider a scenario like "Produce specification review." It involves numerous stakeholders and collaborators, making real-time communication seem most effective. But think again. Does a "review" truly require a meeting? </p>

<p>It's more of a "process" type of work; you simply need to share a document across the organization for everyone to sign off. In such cases, "real-time communication" is unnecessary.</p>

<p>The more unnecessary meetings, the less efficient a team becomes. In the long term, your team might become "<strong>meeting-dependent</strong>" treating every issue as if it requires a meeting to resolve, unable to complete tasks without one.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The second problem is skyrocketing organisational cost
</h3>

<p>Meetings come at a cost. </p>

<p>A meeting's cost = number of people in a meeting x average salary of participants x meeting time. </p>

<p>If someone is less efficient, it is quite simple = organisation costs increase. </p>

<p>But in a meeting, the more senior the participants are in a meeting, the more costs multiplied. Thus the cost of low-efficient + low-effect meetings are incrementally larger.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Emotional damage
</h3>

<p>I believe most of people are the same--we want our time invested yield equitable results. But low efficiency meetings demand your time whilst it doesn't give you the result. You will simply be less happy with fewer achievements.</p>

<p>The scarier part: the amount of things you need to do won't become less if you have more meetings. </p>

<p>If you spend time on meetings, you will need to work extra hours to finish your work. You will be less efficient and might end up hating yourself, even harming your mental status. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Everyone wants to be more efficient. Time is everything.
</h2>

<h2>
  
  
  Just scratching the surface
</h2>

<p>What other hidden costs and solutions lie beneath the surface?</p>

<p>How can we liberate ourselves from the shackles of inefficient gatherings and unlock the true potential of our teams?</p>

<p>Running a sprint like Hackathon and everyone squashed in one room until EVERYTHING IS DONE. Those are fun. I love it. But are they effective? We can't ask everyone to "be more mindful" because it just doesn't solve the problem and it might also discourage people to bring up real problem in the company.</p>

<p>If embedding one's philosophy within a product is every founder's dream, I have a question: </p>

<p><em>what product is out there to help us to be better at meetings?</em></p>
