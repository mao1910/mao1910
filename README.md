 #### - [How to Improve Front-end performance??ü§î](https://dev.to/manish7107/how-to-improve-front-end-performance-3ag7) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Improving front-end performance is crucial for creating fast and responsive web applications. Here are some tips to help you enhance the performance of your front-end code:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Images and Media:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use appropriate image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, SVG) for different types of images.</li>
<li>Compress images to reduce file size without sacrificing quality.</li>
<li>Lazy load images to only load them when they are in the viewport.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize HTTP Requests:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the number of requests by combining CSS and JavaScript files, using sprite sheets, and avoiding excessive use of external resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Utilize Browser Caching:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set appropriate cache headers to allow the browser to store resources locally. This reduces the need for repeated downloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minify and Bundle Files:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files to remove unnecessary characters like whitespace, comments, and newline characters.</li>
<li>Bundle multiple smaller files into a single, larger file to reduce the number of HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Critical Rendering Path:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Prioritize the loading of critical resources needed for initial rendering (e.g., inline critical CSS, preload resources).</li>
<li>Avoid render-blocking resources in the head section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Leverage CDNs to distribute static resources across multiple servers, reducing server load and improving load times for users globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose Efficient CSS Selectors:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid using complex selectors or over-qualified selectors. Specificity can slow down rendering times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize CSS and JavaScript Performance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid unnecessary animations and transitions, as they can hinder performance.</li>
<li>Use asynchronous and deferred loading for non-critical scripts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implement Responsive Web Design:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use CSS media queries to ensure your website is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid Render-Blocking Scripts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Load non-essential scripts after the initial rendering or use techniques like <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize Fonts:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use system fonts or a small set of web-safe fonts to reduce font loading times.</li>
<li>Consider using font-display CSS property to control how fonts are displayed while they are still loading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monitor and Analyze Performance:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use tools like Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, and browser developer tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize JavaScript Execution:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid unnecessary calculations and DOM manipulations, especially in loops.</li>
<li>Use efficient algorithms and data structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduce DOM Manipulations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Minimize the frequency of DOM updates and try to batch them when possible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For content-heavy sites, consider generating HTML on the server or at build time to reduce client-side rendering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember to test your website's performance on various devices and network conditions to ensure a smooth experience for all users. Additionally, regularly monitor and address performance issues as your application evolves.</p>

<p>You are given an integer array <code>height</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two <code>endpoints</code> of the <code>ith</code> line are <code>(i, 0)</code> and <code>(i, height[i]).</code><br>
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.<br>
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.<br>
Notice that you may not slant the container.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
Input: height = <code>[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]</code><br>
Output: <code>49</code><br>
Explanation: <code>The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</code></p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
Input: height = <code>[1,1]</code><br>
Output: <code>1</code></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Intuition:
</h2>

<p>The code aims to find the maximum area between two lines in a histogram, where the lines represent the heights of bars.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Approach:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Initialize pointers at both ends of the histogram (LeftPointer at 0 and RightPointer at the last element).</li>
<li>While the LeftPointer is less than the RightPointer:</li>
<li>Calculate the area between the lines formed by the heights at LeftPointer and RightPointer.</li>
<li>Update the MaximumArea if the current area is greater.</li>
<li>Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward (towards the other pointer).</li>
<li>Repeat step 2 until the pointers meet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Complexity:
</h2>

<p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(n) where n is the number of elements in the height array. We iterate through the array once.<br>
<strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Code:
</h2>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int MaximumArea = 0;
        int LeftPointer = 0;
        int RightPointer = height.length - 1;

        while(LeftPointer &lt; RightPointer){
            if(height[LeftPointer] &lt; height[RightPointer]){
                MaximumArea = Math.max(MaximumArea , height[LeftPointer] *(RightPointer - LeftPointer));
                LeftPointer++;
            }
            else{
                MaximumArea = Math.max(MaximumArea ,height[RightPointer] *(RightPointer - LeftPointer));
                RightPointer--;
            }
        }

        return MaximumArea;

 #### - [Rest VS gRPC](https://dev.to/hasanelsherbiny/rest-vs-grpc-1bj3) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Since the first appearance of API there has been many approaches to make it simpler and much powerful and easy to use.<br>
if you don't know <a href="https://dev.to/hasanelsherbiny/what-is-api-21bc">what is API read this article</a></p>

<p>this is a quick comparison between REST And gRPC APIS</p>

<p>REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. <br>
It is not a protocol, but a set of constraints and principles for creating web services.</p>

<p>REST APIs are built considering these concepts:<br>
Resources: In REST, everything is a resource, which can be a physical object, a piece of data or a service. <br>
Each resource is identified by a uniqu URL.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>HTTP Methods: <br>
REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resourcs</p></li>
<li><p>Stateless:<br>
RESTful APIs are statelss, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfil the request</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3.Representation: <br>
Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, which clients can request based on their needs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose REST?
</h2>

<p>Simplicity: REST is easy to understand and implement making it a popular choice for web APIs</p>

<p>Language Agnostic: Clients and servers can be written in different programming languages promoting interoperability.</p>

<p>Caching: REST leverage HTTP caching mechanisms for better performance.</p>

<p>Maturity: REST has been around for a long time and has widespread support in various web frameworks and tools.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Drawbacks of REST
</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Overfetching / Underfetching: Clients may receive more or less data than they need impacting efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Latency: Multiple round-trips can result in higher latency when dealing with complex operations.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  So What Is gRPC?
</h2>

<p>gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google that allows you to define RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services and generate client-server code for multiple programming languages. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for data serialization and HTTP/2 for transport.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose gRPC?
</h2>

<p>1.IDL (Interface Definition Language): <br>
gRPC uses a language-agnostic IDL to define services and message types. These definitions can then be used to generate client and server code in multiple languages.</p>

<p>2.Strongly Typed: <br>
Data serialization with protobufs is strongly typed reducing the chances of runtime errors due to data mismatches.</p>

<p>3.HTTP/2: <br>
gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, offering features like multiplexing, flow control, and header compression which enhance performance.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose gRPC?
</h2>

<p>1.Bidirectional Streaming: <br>
gRPC supports bidirectional streaming allowing both the client and server to send a stream of messages.</p>

<p>2.Efficiency: <br>
gRPC's use of HTTP/2 and binary serialization makes it highly efficient in terms of bandwidth and latency.</p>

<p>3.Code Generation: <br>
gRPC automatically generates client and server code reducing the likelihood of human error.</p>

<p>4.Strong Typing: <br>
Protobufs ensure strong typing and versioning of data contracts.</p>

<p>5.Bidirectional Streaming: <br>
Ideal for real-time applications and chat systems.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Drawbacks of gRPC
</h2>

<p>1.Complexity: <br>
The additional complexity of protobuf definitions and code generation can be challenging for some developers.</p>

<p>2.Learning Curve: <br>
Learning to work with gRPC may require additional time and effort.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  When To Choose REST OR gRPC?
</h2>

<p>This depends project's requirements and constraints but</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Use REST if:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>You need simplicity and quick development.</li>
<li>Your clients and servers are implemented in different languages.</li>
<li>You want to leverage the maturty and existing support of REST in web frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Use gRPC if:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>You prioritize efficiency and low latency.</li>
<li>You have strong typing and versioning requirements.</li>
<li>Bidirectional streaming or real-time communication is essential.</li>
<li>You want to benefit from code generation and maintainable APIs.</li>
</ul>

 #### - [Firefox form auto-fill](https://dev.to/michalbryxi/firefox-form-auto-fill-25pi) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Problem
</h2>

<p>One of the trivial, yet crucial UX issues I have with the Firefox web browser is that the other browsers do absolutely smashing job in auto-filling addresses.</p>

<p>Basically I just fill my address in once, the browser remembers and then I can select the remembered option in any web page and 90% of the form will be filled in correctly.</p>

<p>It sounds trivial, but filling in my physical address is surprisingly common workflow on contemporary web.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Research
</h2>

<p>I tried to follow the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/automatically-fill-your-address-web-forms-android">Automatically fill in your address on web forms in Firefox for Android</a> from Mozilla, but mentioned settings options are not even available in my version (<code>118.0b6</code>).</p>

<p>After a bit of research I found out that <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Features/Form_Autofill#Feature_Availability">Firefox/Features/Form Autofill</a> contains the answer. <strong>Important</strong>: Since this article will inevitably go out of date, please refer to the linked official documentation for the correct way.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Solution
</h2>

<ol>
<li>In the address bar type in <code>about:config</code> and press enter.</li>
<li>Search for <code>extensions.formautofill.addresses</code>
</li>
<li><code>extensions.formautofill.addresses.capture.enabled = true</code></li>
<li>
<code>extensions.formautofill.addresses.capture.v2.enabled = true</code> 

<ul>
<li>Not exactly sure what is the difference between this and the previous one, but can't hurt?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>extensions.formautofill.addresses.supported = on</code></li>
<li>
<code>extensions.formautofill.addresses.supportedCountries = US,CA,CH,CZ,GB</code> 

<ul>
<li>My country is Switzerland, therefore I added <code>CH</code> to this list. List of country codes follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO 3166</a> <em>aplha-2 code</em> standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Restart browser</li>
<li>Now you should see in the <code>Settings</code> new item in <code>Forms and Autofill</code>
</li>
