<h2>
  
  
  0.19 Release Updates
</h2>

<p>We're eager to showcase the latest features in our most recent release. Let's dive in and discover what's in store for you!</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4MlQCGXY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2946769/38f8c51d-4cf0-4789-93eb-e29d87df3e06" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4MlQCGXY--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2946769/38f8c51d-4cf0-4789-93eb-e29d87df3e06" alt="giphy (2) (1)" width="500" height="280"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Multi-tenancy Management
</h2>

<p>We are stoked to let you know that you can now manage tenants from the <a href="https://web.novu.co/tenants">UI</a> (Novu’s dashboard) and the <a href="[https://api.novu.co/api#/Tenants](https://api.novu.co/api#/Tenants)">API</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--feVyJ6s2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2946769/85bd75ef-0b24-492b-8186-2365197302ff" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--feVyJ6s2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://github.com/novuhq/novu/assets/2946769/85bd75ef-0b24-492b-8186-2365197302ff" alt="tenants-management (1)" width="800" height="568"></a></p>

<p>Self-hosted users need to add and turn on the <code>IS_MULTI_TENANCY_ENABLED</code> env flag to be able to manage tenants in their Novu installation.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Tenants Usage in Workflows as Variables
</h2>

<p>With tenants feature now generally available, there are different ways you’ll be able to use it in your app depending on your use case.</p>

<p>One of those ways is using it as variables in your workflows and triggers. When triggering a notification using the events trigger endpoint, you can pass in a tenant property as a parameter like so:<br>

<h2>
  
  
  Bulk Subscriber Creation
</h2>

<p>This release also ships the wildly requested “bulk subscriber creation.” You’ll be able to create subscribers in bulk (up to 500 at once) using an <a href="https://docs.novu.co/api-reference/subscribers/bulk-create-subscribers">API endpoint</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The bulk API is limited to 500 subscribers per request.<br>

<h2>
  
  
  Addition of Tags in Workflow Settings
</h2>

<p>We have added the ability to use tags in the workflow settings screen. </p>

<p>This change allows use cases where you need to group multiple workflows under the same tag, and then use it to filter subscriber preferences for example.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Allow Override layout On Trigger

<p>To override your assigned layout during a trigger event use the <code>layoutIdentifier</code> property, the layout specified will be used for all emails in the context of that trigger event.<br>

<p>In the following sections, I'll guide you through the process of creating an Approval Mechanism for Statamic.</p>

<p>This article is structured as follows:</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Who is this article for?
</h2>

<p>This article is primarily aimed at Statamic developers who are already acquainted with Statamic's core concepts and have a basic understanding of PHP and Laravel. To fully comprehend and implement the Approval Mechanism discussed here, readers should be familiar with key Statamic elements like entries and blueprints.</p>

<p>Additionally, a basic grasp of Vue.js for handling user interface components and API integration knowledge will prove beneficial in following concepts presented in this article.</p>

<p>I would recommended that you also have a basic understanding of <a href="https://statamic.dev/extending">extending Statamic</a>, but if you're new to this, it's a good idea to explore those concepts beforehand for a smoother learning experience.</p>

<p>You need <strong>Statamic Pro</strong> to enable the revisions feature.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What we are about to do
</h2>

<p>In this article, our primary objective is to create an Approval Mechanism within Statamic, emphasizing the process of managing entries and enabling a structured review and feedback workflow. While we briefly touch on data import as context, our main focus lies in developing this mechanism. We'll explore how to efficiently flag entries as 'Needs Review,' facilitate feedback from CMS authors through a built-in feedback form, and dynamically update entry statuses for better organization.</p>

<p>Additionally, we'll demonstrate how to log feedback and maintain feedback history as part of this comprehensive solution. For illustration, we'll use a 'persons' collection where each person is associated with a unique 'external_service_id,' linking them to external data sources.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What's a working copy?
</h2>

<p>Working copies serve as a <strong>temporary version</strong> of an entry, generated when you edit and save an existing entry. You then have the option to create a revision or proceed with publication. Should you opt for a revision or publication, the working copy will be discarded. Conversely, choosing to save your changes ensures that the working copy is promptly updated.</p>

<p>By default working copies are saved inside the revisions folder. The path can be set in the <code>config/statamic/revisions.php</code> file. By default it's set to <code>storage_path('statamic/revisions')</code>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Let's bring in the data!
</h2>

<p>We assume we already have some existing persons in our collection. Inside our import method we want to update or create a working copy of each entry.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$personEntries</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nv">$personEntry</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$personEntry</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">hasWorkingCopy</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// Update working copy</span>
    <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// Create working copy</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Now let's implement these methods. We are assuming that the <strong>new data</strong> comes in an array that represents the data structure of our person blueprint. For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="nv">$newData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s1">'name'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'Smeagol'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s1">'diet'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'juicy sweet fish'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s1">'job_title'</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'Tourist Guide'</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">];</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Creating</strong> the working copy<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">createWorkingCopy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Entry</span> <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">array</span> <span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Set the new data</span>
    <span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$data</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nv">$key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$value</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// Create a working copy from the entry</span>
    <span class="nv">$workingCopy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">makeWorkingCopy</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="c1">// Save the working copy</span>
    <span class="nv">$workingCopy</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">save</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Updating</strong> the working copy is a little more complicated since the data can't be set directly on the working copy. We have to get the data from the working copy, update it and then save it again.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">updateWorkingCopy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Entry</span> <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">array</span> <span class="nv">$newData</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Get current data from the data attribute and merge it with the new data.</span>
    <span class="nv">$currentData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">workingCopy</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">attribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'data'</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nv">$updatedData</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mf">...</span><span class="nv">$currentData</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">...</span><span class="nv">$newPureData</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="nv">$entry</span>
        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">workingCopy</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">attribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'data'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$updatedData</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">save</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>So, at the moment, we always create or update a working copy and overwrite a possible existing one. In this case, that's okay, but you may want to check if there is already a working copy, and if so, create a new revision instead of overwriting the working copy. But that results in potentially a lot of revisions. So you have to decide what's best for you. I will only cover the working copy case here.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should have a field in your entries blueprint where you save the last imported date to check if the incoming data is newer than the last import. If not, you can skip the entry. That, of course, presupposes that your external data also provides some kind of 'updated_at' field.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Let authors know that there's something to review
</h2>

<p>What we did before is basically everything you need to have a simple approval mechanism where new data gets saved inside a working copy to be reviewed. But we want to give the CMS authors a hint that there is something to review. We will do this by adding a status field.</p>

<p>What we need is a custom field type that we can use in our blueprint. I won't go into detail here about how to create a custom field type. You can read about it in the <a href="https://statamic.dev/extending/fieldtypes">Statamic documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We will create a custom field type called 'approval_status' that will have three possible values: 'needs_review,' 'approved,' and 'feedback_sent.'</p>

<p>We will add some methods to our ApprovalStatus.php fieldtype class to check the status.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">preProcessIndex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">getStatus</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">preload</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">getStatus</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">protected</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">getStatus</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="kt">array</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nv">$entry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="nf">field</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="k">parent</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nc">ApprovalStatus</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nf">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>As you can see, it can be better to outsource the logic to a separate class. We will create an ApprovalStatus class that will have a static method to get the status. This method will use a variable <code>$feedbackDate</code>. This variable will be set when the CMS author gives feedback and deleted when the working copy is published. We will cover this later.</p>

<p>Here's a little diagram that visually explains the logic behind the status check:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2QW8X5-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nxdpy58dxq30m44tqp1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2QW8X5-1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8nxdpy58dxq30m44tqp1.png" alt="The logic behind the approval status" width="800" height="453"></a></p>

<p>… and the corresponding code:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight php"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">static</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">Entry</span> <span class="nv">$entry</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="kt">array</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The Vue components to our ApprovalStatus field type class are pretty simple. They get the status with the help of the <code>preload()</code> and the <code>preProcessIndex()</code> methods.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// ApprovalStatus.vue</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">template</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/template</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span></code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="c1">// ApprovalStatusIndex.vue</span>

<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">template</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">span</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">status</span> <span class="p">}}</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/span</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/template</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>You can also add your classes and pass a color to your status array to style the status in the control panel. You can find more information about index field types here: <a href="https://statamic.dev/extending/fieldtypes#index-fieldtypes">Statamic Index Fieldtypes</a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Create a feedback form
</h3>

<p>The form is also a custom fieldtype. It will have a textarea and a button to submit the feedback. We assume that the person entry has an email stored. We can write our feedback into the text field and with the click on the button, we will make a post request to a custom route that takes care of error handling and sending the mail. After sending the mail, we want to disable the form and the button to prevent multiple feedbacks.</p>

<p>This is how the Vue component can look like:<br>

<h3>
  
  
  Tracking feedback and dates
</h3>

<p>To allow a better overview of previous sent feedback, you can log your feedback in a replicator field below the feedback form. Simply add some code to the method that handles your post request from the form component above. Let's assume this method is inside the same class as the create and update working copy methods.<br>

<h2>
  
  
  Handling publication
</h2>

<p>To finish up the approval mechanism, we just have to delete the feedback date automatically when the entry gets published. We can achieve this by <a href="https://statamic.dev/extending/events#overview">listening to the <code>EntrySaved</code></a> vent. We will create a listener class that will check if the entry is from the persons collection and has set a feedback date and if so, delete the feedback date.<br>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>Great! 🎉 We now have a simple approval mechanism for our Statamic application. Of course, you can extend this mechanism to your needs. For example, you can add a field to your entries blueprint where you can set the email address of the person that should review the entry or for the person that should review it. It's also very handy to add a filter to your index view to filter for entries that need a review.</p>

<p>When handling multisites, you should think about if you want to have a separate approval mechanism for each site or if you want to have a global one. In my case, I disabled the review form for any other language than the default one, and the authors are always sending reviews for all localizations in one mail. When creating and updating the working copy, you have to update each localization separately. Take a look at the <code>$entry-&gt;descendants()</code> method to get all localizations of an entry.</p>

 #### - [Solving "Diameter of Binary Tree" Leet code Question](https://dev.to/leetcode/solving-diameter-of-binary-tree-leet-code-question-264l) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Intuition
</h2>

<p>We want to find the diameter of a <code>binary tree</code>, which is the length of the longest <code>path</code> between any two nodes. This path may or may not pass through the <code>root</code>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Approach
</h2>

<p>We perform a depth-first traversal of the tree and calculate the height of each subtree. While calculating the height of each node, we also update the diameter if a longer path is found. The final result will be stored in the <code>diameter</code> variable.</p>

<p><strong>Time complexity</strong><br>
O(n) - We visit each node once.</p>

<p><strong>Space complexity</strong><br>
O(h) - Recursive call stack space, where h is the height of the tree.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Code
</h2>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    int diameter = 0;

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        height(root);
        return diameter;
    }

    public int height(TreeNode node){

        if(node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int lh = height(node.left);
        int rh = height(node.right);
        diameter = Math.max(diameter,lh+rh);

        return 1 + Math.max(lh,rh);
    }
}
