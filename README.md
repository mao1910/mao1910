 #### - [Top 6 Most Popular API Architecture Styles You Need to Know (with Pros, Cons, and Use Cases)](https://dev.to/kanani_nirav/top-6-most-popular-api-architecture-styles-you-need-to-know-with-pros-cons-and-use-cases-564j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In this article, we will discuss about 6 Most Popular API Architecture Styles: <strong>REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, and Webhooks.</strong></p>

<p>APIs are ways for software to talk to each other and share data. There are different ways to design and build APIs. Let‚Äôs see the top 6 API Architecture Styles and their pros, cons, and Use Cases.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  REST
</h2>

<p>REST is a way to use web standards and addresses to work with data on a server. They‚Äôre popular, easy to implement, and use HTTP methods. Most of the web services you interact with daily, like Twitter or YouTube, are powered by Restful APIs. For example, a client can use GET to get data, POST to make new data, PUT to change data, or DELETE to remove data. The data are usually in formats like JSON or XML.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is simple and easy to use and understand.</p></li>
<li><p>It follows the rules of the web and uses existing standards and protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>It is fast and can handle many requests, as it supports caching and statelessness.</p></li>
<li><p>It is flexible and can use different formats and media types.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not have a clear contract or schema, which can make it unclear and inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not support complex queries or operations, which can make it need many requests and get too much or too little data.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not handle errors or exceptions well, as it uses HTTP status codes that are not always clear or correct.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>REST is good for situations where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The data model is simple and stable.</p></li>
<li><p>The clients and servers are not dependent on each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed and scalability are important.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  SOAP
</h2>

<p>SOAP is s style that uses XML messages and a predefined contract to exchange information between applications. It has a clear and strict contract, and it supports complex queries and operations, but it is complex, verbose, and not scalable or performant.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It has a clear and strict contract that ensures interoperability and compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports complex queries and operations, such as transactions, security, or authentication.</p></li>
<li><p>It handles errors and exceptions well, as it uses SOAP faults that provide detailed information.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is complex and verbose to use and understand.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not follow the principles of the web and adds overhead to the existing protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not scalable or performant, as it does not support caching or statelessness.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not flexible or extensible, as it requires changes to the contract for any modifications.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>SOAP is suitable for scenarios where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The data model is complex and dynamic.</p></li>
<li><p>The clients and servers are tightly coupled and dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs heavily used in financial services and payment gateways where security and reliability are key</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  GraphQL
</h2>

<p>GraphQL is not just an architectural style but also a query language, allowing clients to ask for specific data as they need. This means no more over-fetching or under-fetching of data. You ask for exactly what you need. This leads to more efficient network communication and faster responses. Facebook developed GraphQL to deliver efficient and precise data to its billions of users. Now it‚Äôs used by companies like GitHub and Shopify. Its flexibility and efficiency make it a strong choice for applications with complex data requirements. It also supports mutations to change the data, and subscriptions to get live updates when the data changes.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It works with any server language or framework, as it uses its own schema definition language.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a single endpoint, which makes it more efficient than REST, where multiple requests might be needed to get enough data.</p></li>
<li><p>It is strongly typed, which makes sure the data is consistent and compatible between the client and the server.</p></li>
<li><p>It lets clients fetch only the data they need, which avoids over-fetching or under-fetching of data.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is complex and hard to use and understand, as it requires learning a new syntax and logic.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not support caching by default, which can affect performance and scalability.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not handle errors well, as it always returns HTTP 200 status code, even if there are errors in the GraphQL layer.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>GraphQL is good for situations where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The data model is complex and dynamic, as it can handle nested and relational data.</p></li>
<li><p>The clients and servers are not dependent on each other, as it lets clients define their own data requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>The bandwidth and performance are important, as it reduces the amount of data transferred.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  gRPC
</h2>

<p>gRPC is modern, high-performance, and uses protocol buffers. It‚Äôs a favorite for microservices architectures, and companies like Netflix use gRPC to handle their immense interservice communication. However, if you‚Äôre dealing with browser clients, gRPC might pose some challenges due to limited browser support.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It has a clear and strict contract, which ensures interoperability and compatibility between services.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports complex queries and operations, such as streaming, bidirectional communication, authentication, or encryption.</p></li>
<li><p>It is fast and efficient, as it uses binary format and HTTP/2 features to reduce latency and bandwidth.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is complex and hard to use and understand, as it requires generating and compiling protocol buffer files.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not follow the principles of the web, as it uses custom headers and methods that are not compatible with standard web tools or browsers.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>gRPC is good for situations where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The data model is complex and dynamic, as it can handle structured and unstructured data.</p></li>
<li><p>The services are dependent on each other, as it allows services to invoke each other‚Äôs methods directly.</p></li>
<li><p>The speed and efficiency are important, as it minimizes the overhead and maximizes the throughput.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  WebSocket
</h2>

<p>WebSocket is all about real-time, bidirectional, and persistent connections. It‚Äôs perfect for live chat applications and real-time gaming, where low-latency data exchange is crucial.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is faster and more efficient than HTTP, as it uses a single connection and does not need headers or cookies for each message.</p></li>
<li><p>It can send and receive different types of messages over the same connection, such as text, binary, or streaming data.</p></li>
<li><p>It can push data from the server to the client without waiting for a request, which enables real-time and event-driven communication.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It‚Äôs not supported by some older browsers or proxies that do not understand the WebSocket protocol or the upgrade header.</p></li>
<li><p>It‚Äôs not secure by default, as they do not use encryption or authentication unless they use the <code>wss://</code> scheme, which is similar to <code>https://</code> for HTTP.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not store any information about the connection or the messages on either side, which means they are not stateful.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>WebSocket is good for situations where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The web application needs fast and interactive data exchange, such as chat, gaming, or streaming.</p></li>
<li><p>The web application needs bidirectional and multiplexed communication, where both sides can send and receive multiple messages of different types at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>The web application needs real-time and event-driven communication, where the server can send data to the client without waiting for a request.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Webhooks
</h2>

<p>Webhooks are a way for servers to send messages to clients when something happens. They use HTTP callbacks or POST requests to deliver payloads that contain information about the events. The clients register their webhooks with the servers by providing URLs that can receive the payloads. Webhook is all about event-driven, HTTP callbacks, and asynchronous operation.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pros
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It is simple and easy to use and understand, as it uses standard HTTP methods and formats.</p></li>
<li><p>It follows the principles of the web, as it leverages existing standards and protocols.</p></li>
<li><p>It is scalable and performant, as it supports asynchronous communication without polling or waiting.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Cons
</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not have a clear or strict contract, which can lead to inconsistency and ambiguity between servers and clients.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not support complex queries or operations, it only sends one-way notifications without confirmation or feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not handle errors well, It does not provide retries or acknowledgments in case of failures.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Usage
</h3>

<p>Webhooks are good for situations where:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Event-driven notifications ( GitHub uses webhooks to notify your other systems whenever a new commit is pushed.)</p></li>
<li><p>The data model is simple and stable, as it can handle basic types and fields.</p></li>
<li><p>The servers and clients are not dependent on each other, as they do not require direct communication or coordination.</p></li>
<li><p>The performance and scalability are important, as they reduce the load and latency of the communication.</p></li>
</ul>

 #### - [The Entire Process Of Handling URL Requests.](https://dev.to/code_lover/the-entire-process-of-handling-url-requests-1nbd) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>Case-Study</strong>: Looking at the "<a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>" URL.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In the modern digital age, the World Wide Web has become an integral part of our lives. Every time you open your browser, type in a URL, and press Enter, a complex process unfolds behind the scenes. This article will guide you through the journey of a web request, explaining each step in detail, from the moment you type "<a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>" into your browser to the moment you see the Google homepage.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>DNS Request</em> (Domain Name System)</li>
</ol>

<p>The journey begins with the Domain Name System (DNS). When you enter a URL like "<a href="http://www.google.com,">www.google.com,</a>" your computer doesn't know where to find Google's servers. It sends a DNS request to a DNS server, which acts like an internet phonebook. The DNS server translates the human-readable domain name ("<a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com"</a>) into an IP address, such as "216.58.214.36." This IP address is essential for your computer to locate the target server on the internet.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>TCP/IP</em> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</li>
</ol>

<p>With the IP address in hand, your computer initiates a connection using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP ensures that data is transmitted reliably, breaking it into small packets and verifying their successful delivery. IP, on the other hand, routes these packets across the internet to the destination server, Google's in this case.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Firewall</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Firewalls act as gatekeepers for your computer. They filter incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking any potentially harmful or unauthorized data packets. Firewalls help ensure your computer's security by allowing only trusted connections to pass through.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<em>HTTPS/SSL</em> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer)</li>
</ol>

<p>Security is paramount when transmitting sensitive information over the internet. To establish a secure connection, your browser and the web server engage in a process called the SSL handshake. During this handshake, they exchange cryptographic keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The resulting secure connection is identified by "https://" in the URL and the padlock icon in your browser's address bar.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Load-Balancer</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Large websites like Google handle enormous traffic daily. To distribute this load efficiently, they use load balancers. A load balancer acts as an intermediary between your request and the web servers. It evaluates the servers' current load and directs your request to the server that can best handle it. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, even during peak traffic times.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Web Server</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Once your request reaches the web server, it begins processing. Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS are responsible for handling incoming requests, processing dynamic content, and generating the HTML that your browser will render. In Google's case, their web servers process billions of search queries every day.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Application Server</em></li>
</ol>

<p>For dynamic web applications, there's often a middle layer known as the application server. It handles tasks like database queries, business logic, and user authentication. In Google's context, this layer plays a crucial role in delivering personalized search results, managing user accounts, and handling various backend processes.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Database</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Behind every web application is a database that stores, retrieves, and manages data. In Google's case, this includes storing indexed web pages, user preferences, and search history. Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases are used to efficiently handle vast amounts of data.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The seemingly simple act of typing "<a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a>" into your browser and pressing Enter sets off a chain of complex processes that involve DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. This intricate web of technologies and protocols ensures that you can access information swiftly and securely on the internet.</p>

<p>Understanding this journey is not only crucial for software engineers but for anyone who wants to appreciate the complexity and reliability of the web. It highlights the importance of each component in delivering a seamless browsing experience, and it showcases the innovations that make the internet an indispensable part of our daily lives.</p>

<p>In today's tech-centric world, grasping the inner workings of web requests can open doors to exciting career opportunities. By mastering these concepts, you're not only ahead of the curve but also better equipped to navigate the intricacies of the digital landscape. So, the next time you enter a URL and press Enter, remember the fascinating journey your request embarks on, making the web a global phenomenon that connects us all.</p>

 #### - [What's in my bag for Experts Live Europe](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/whats-in-my-bag-for-experts-live-europe-9dn) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>I am very excited to attend Experts Live Europe, a community-driven IT conference focused on Microsoft cloud, datacenter, security and modern workplace technologies. This event will take place in Prague, Czech Republic from September 18 to 20, 2023. I will be joining hundreds of other IT professionals who are eager to learn from the best experts worldwide, network with peers, and have fun in the beautiful city of Prague.</p>

<p>As a speaker and remote worker, I always want to be prepared for any situation that might arise during the conference. That's why I have packed my bag with some essential items that I think will help me make the most out of this event. Here is a list of what's in my bag for Experts Live Europe:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Laptops</strong>: This is a no-brainer. I need my laptop to take notes, write blog posts, check emails, and do some coding if needed. I have a Microsoft Surface Book 3 with Windows 11, which is lightweight, powerful, and has a great battery life. It also comes with a touch screen and a stylus pen, which are very handy for sketching diagrams or annotating slides.
But I need to work even for SoftwareONE in these days and this is the reason why I have a second laptop with me: my Laptop 4 with Windows 11. On this laptop I have only things related to SoftwareONE and its project (Red Origin product, for example).</li>
<li>
<strong>Smartphone</strong>: Another obvious item. I use my smartphone to stay connected with the world, take photos and videos, scan QR codes, and use various apps that are useful for the conference. I have my iPhone 13, which has an amazing camera, a large screen, and a fast processor. It also supports wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, which are very convenient features. It's not in the photo because I use it for taking this picture. üôÇ</li>
<li>
<strong>Power bank</strong>: Even though my laptop and smartphone have good battery life, I don't want to risk running out of juice in the middle of the day. That's why I always carry a power bank with me. I have an XTorm 20000mAh, which can charge my devices multiple times and has two USB ports for simultaneous charging. It also has a LED indicator that shows how much power is left. Very often I use the power bank to charge even my sports watch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Headphones</strong>: Sometimes I need to tune out the noise and focus on my work or relax with some music. That's why I always have headphones with me. I have a pair of AirPods Max wireless noise-canceling headphones, which are very comfortable, have excellent sound quality, and block out most of the ambient noise. They also have touch controls. I also have with me the AirPods Pro because sometimes they are more handy during the day.</li>
<li>
<strong>HDMI adapter</strong>: I need to connect my laptop to an external monitor or projector. That's why I always have an HDMI adapter with me. I have a Mokin HDMI adapter, which is very simple, reliable, and compatible with my laptop. It also supports 4K resolution and it has two HDMI output. In the same adapter I have three USB 3.0, a Lan and an USB-C.</li>
<li>*<em>Cables</em>: I have a box with 1 Billion cables, USB, USB-C, for charging iPhones and headphones and I have also a multiple USB charger for charging up to 4 devices at the same time.</li>
<li>
<strong>DIJ</strong>: I have also my DJI for the iPhone. Very often I make some videos or timelapse during the event or for my social accounts. It's very useful and it works very well since years.</li>
<li>
<strong>Logitech MX Master</strong>: my favorite mouse ever. I use the MX Master since the first release. This is not the last model but still working very good and even the next one will be an MX Master. I can connect up to 3 devices with a simple switch. For me it's perfect because I have my main device (my gaming pc at home that I use as the main machine), my Book 3 and my Laptop 4. I don't use the mouse on my MacBook Air.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the items that are in my bag for Experts Live Europe. Of course, everyone has their own preferences and needs when it comes to packing their bags for an event like this. But I hope that this list can give you some ideas or inspiration for your own packing. I look forward to seeing you at Experts Live Europe and sharing our experiences and learnings. Until then, stay safe!</p>
