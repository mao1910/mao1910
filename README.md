<h2>Node.js Express and MongoDB with Docker Overview</h2>

<p>Assume that we have a Nodejs Application working with MongoDB database.<br>
The problem is to containerize a system that requires more than one Docker container:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Node.js Express for API</li>
    <li>MongoDB for database</li>
</ul>

<p>Docker Compose helps us setup the system more easily and efficiently than with only Docker. We're gonna following these steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create Nodejs App working with MongoDB database.</li>
    <li>Create Dockerfile for Nodejs App.</li>
    <li>Write Docker Compose configurations in YAML file.</li>
    <li>Set Environment variables for Docker Compose</li>
    <li>Run the system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Directory Structure:</p>

<h2>Create Nodejs App</h2>

<p>You can read and get Github source code from one of following tutorials:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bezkoder.com/node-express-mongodb-crud-rest-api/">Node.js Express Rest API with MongoDb</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bezkoder.com/node-js-mongodb-pagination/">Node.js Express Pagination with Mongoose and MongoDB</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bezkoder.com/node-js-mongodb-auth-jwt/">Node.js + MongoDB: User Authentication &amp; Authorization</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://bezkoder.com/node-js-upload-store-images-mongodb/">Upload/store images in MongoDB using Node.js, Express &amp; Multer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Using the code base above, we put the Nodejs project in <strong>bezkoder-app</strong> folder and modify some files to work with environment variables.</p>

<p>Firstly, let's add <code>dotenv</code> module into <em>package.json</em>.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="err">...</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"dependencies"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"dotenv"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"^10.0.0"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="err">...</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>Next we import <code>dotenv</code> in <em>server.js</em> and use <code>process.env</code> for setting port.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">dotenv</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">config</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">..</span>
<span class="c1">// set port, listen for requests</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">PORT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NODE_DOCKER_PORT</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="mi">8080</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">PORT</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">`Server is running on port </span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">PORT</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">.`</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Then we change modify database configuration and initialization.</p>

<p><strong>app</strong>/<strong>config</strong>/<em>db.config.js</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">DB_USER</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">DB_PASSWORD</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">DB_HOST</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">DB_PORT</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">DB_NAME</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">`mongodb://</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">DB_USER</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">DB_PASSWORD</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">@</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">DB_HOST</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">DB_PORT</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">/</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">DB_NAME</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">?authSource=admin`</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>We also need to make a <em>.env</em> sample file that shows all necessary arguments.</p>

<p><strong>bezkoder-app</strong>/<em>.env.sample</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight properties"><code><span class="py">DB_HOST</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">localhost</span>
<span class="py">DB_USER</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">root</span>
<span class="py">DB_PASSWORD</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">123456</span>
<span class="py">DB_NAME</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">bezkoder_db</span>
<span class="py">DB_PORT</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">27017</span>

<span class="py">NODE_DOCKER_PORT</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">8080</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>Create Dockerfile for Nodejs App</h2>

<p>Dockerfile defines a list of commands that Docker uses for setting up the Node.js application environment. So we put the file in <strong>bezkoder-app</strong> folder.</p>

<p>Because we will use Docker Compose, we won't define all the configuration commands in this Dockerfile.</p>

<p><strong>bezkoder-app</strong>/<em>Dockerfile</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight properties"><code><span class="err">FROM</span> <span class="py">node</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">14</span>

<span class="err">WORKDIR</span> <span class="err">/bezkoder-app</span>
<span class="err">COPY</span> <span class="err">package.json</span> <span class="err">.</span>
<span class="err">RUN</span> <span class="err">npm</span> <span class="err">install</span>
<span class="err">COPY</span> <span class="err">.</span> <span class="err">.</span>
<span class="err">CMD</span> <span class="err">npm</span> <span class="err">start</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Let me explain some points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<code>FROM</code>: install the image of the Node.js version.</li>
    <li>
<code>WORKDIR</code>: path of the working directory.</li>
    <li>
<code>COPY</code>: copy <em>package.json</em> file to the container, then the second one copies all the files inside the project directory.</li>
    <li>
<code>RUN</code>: execute a command-line inside the container: <code>npm install</code> to install the dependencies in <em>package.json</em>.</li>
    <li>
<code>CMD</code>: run script <code>npm start</code> after the image is built.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Write Docker Compose configurations</h2>

<p>On the root of the project directory, we're gonna create the <em>docker-compose.yml</em> file. Follow <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/">version 3</a> syntax defined by Docker:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight properties"><code><span class="py">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">'3.8'</span>

<span class="py">services</span><span class="p">:</span> 
    <span class="s">mongodb:</span>
    <span class="py">app</span><span class="p">:</span>

<span class="py">volumes</span><span class="p">:</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
    <li>
<code>version</code>: Docker Compose file format version will be used.</li>
    <li>
<code>services</code>: individual services in isolated containers. Our application has two services: <code>app</code> (Nodejs) and <code>mongodb</code> (MongoDB database).</li>
    <li>
<code><a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">volumes</a></code>: named volumes that keeps our data alive after restart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's implement the details.</p>

<p><em>docker-compose.yml</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight properties"><code><span class="py">version</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"3.8"</span>

</div>



<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>mongodb</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>image</code>: official Docker image</li>
<li>
<code>restart</code>: configure the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/#use-a-restart-policy">restart policy</a>
</li>
<li>
<code>env_file</code>: specify our <em>.env</em> path that we will create later</li>
<li>
<code>environment</code>: provide setting using environment variables</li>
<li>
<code>ports</code>: specify ports will be used</li>
<li>
<code>volumes</code>: map volume folders</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>

<p><strong>app</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#depends_on">depends_on</a></code>: dependency order, <strong>mongodb</strong> is started before <strong>app</strong>
</li>
<li>
<code>build</code>: configuration options that are applied at build time that we defined in the <em>Dockerfile</em> with relative path</li>
<li>
<code>environment</code>: environmental variables that Node application uses</li>
<li>
<code>stdin_open</code> and <code>tty</code>: keep open the terminal after building container</li>
</ul>


</li>
</ul>

<p>You should note that the host port (<code>LOCAL_PORT</code>) and the container port (<code>DOCKER_PORT</code>) is different. Networked service-to-service communication uses the container port, and the outside uses the host port.</p>

<h2>Docker Compose Environment variables with MongoDB</h2>

<p>In the service configuration, we used environmental variables defined inside the <em>.env</em> file. Now we start writing it.</p>

<p><em>.env</em><br>
</p>

<h2>Run Nodejs MongoDB with Docker Compose</h2>

<p>We can easily run the whole with only a single command:<br>
<code>docker-compose up</code></p>

<p>Docker will pull the MongoDB and Node.js images (if our machine does not have it before).</p>

<p>The services can be run on the background with command:<br>
<code>docker-compose up -d</code><br>
</p>

 #### - [Automating AWS Operations: A Deep Dive into Systems Manager for SysOps](https://dev.to/brandondamue/automating-aws-operations-a-deep-dive-into-systems-manager-for-sysops-30nc) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Wearing my SysOps suit, I've navigated the intricate realm of AWS infrastructure management, and one thing has become abundantly clear: efficiency and control are paramount. In this fast-paced cloud environment, where every second counts and resource management can be a maze, AWS Systems Manager (SSM) emerges as the beacon of hope for SysOps administrators. It's the tool that addresses a multitude of challenges that have often left us scratching our heads.</p>

<p>This article is an expedition into Systems Manager (SSM) and it delves deep into its transformative capabilities, tailored specifically to resolve the challenges that have left SysOps professionals pondering solutions. From providing an all-encompassing view of your infrastructure to streamlining routine tasks and ensuring compliance, SSM furnishes a robust set of solutions poised to revolutionize your AWS environment management. Enough said! Let's get to exploring SSM and its wonderful features but before we get to that here is a concise overview of what SSM is all about.</p>

<p>SSM is like a trusty sidekick for sysops administrators, giving them a single, easy-to-use dashboard to wrangle, automate, and fortify their AWS setup. Imagine it as a Swiss Army knife for sysops, covering everything from keeping tabs on resources and automatic updates to boss-level command execution and smart workflow automation. It even does some neat tricks like secure session management, secret storage, and compliance watchdog duties.</p>

<p>In practical terms, this means sysops folks can breathe a little easier. SSM takes care of repetitive chores, keeps a vigilant eye on security, and makes sure everything plays by the rules. It's like having a skilled assistant who can automate tasks, keep everything in line, and maintain top-notch security across your AWS kingdom. In the end, it's about simplifying the complex, saving time, and lightening the load for sysops teams. Now let's explore the different features and tools that are part of the SSM Swiss army knife.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  System Patch Management
</h2>

<p>With SSM Patch Manager, sysops professionals can streamline and automate patch management for EC2 instances and other AWS resources. Patch Manager allows you to create patch baselines to define which patches should be applied to instances, set up patching schedules, and even automate the patching process using predefined automation documents. This level of automation not only guarantees that your resources stay current with the latest security patches but also trims down the amount of work needed for manually handling patches.</p>

<p>Furthermore, SSM offers strong compliance monitoring and reporting features, giving sysops administrators the tools to uphold top-notch security and compliance standards throughout their AWS setup. SSM's adaptability reaches into cross-platform patching, making it easy to handle patches for servers in on-premises settings and other cloud environments without a hitch. By embracing SSM for patch management, sysops teams can notably boost the security, efficiency, and oversight of their AWS resources while keeping downtime and disruptions to a minimum.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  SSM Run Command
</h2>

<p>Sysops administrators can tap into the efficiency of SSM Run Command to perform tasks on multiple instances simultaneously, making their workload more manageable. This feature proves especially useful for handling routine operations like software installations and configurations across a bunch of instances. Imagine you have a batch of EC2 instances that require crucial security updates. Instead of the tedious process of connecting to each instance individually and applying updates step by step, SSM Run Command enables you to run the necessary commands on all the selected instances simultaneously. This not only slashes the time needed but also maintains uniformity while reducing the chances of mistakes. In simpler terms, it's like having a powerful remote control for your instances. You can send commands to a group of instances all at once, making tasks that used to be painstakingly manual more efficient and reliable. So, whether you're fine-tuning configurations, installing software, or applying security patches, SSM Run Command streamlines the process, making life easier for sysops administrators.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you need to configure specific settings on a group of instances, like adjusting firewall rules or modifying system parameters, SSM Run Command allows you to push these configurations across multiple instances simultaneously. For instance, you can execute commands to update firewall rules to enhance security or change the configurations to optimize resource utilization. This centralized control over command execution not only simplifies the administration of your AWS resources but also enhances security and compliance by ensuring that all instances are configured consistently according to your desired specifications. In essence, SSM Run Command empowers sysops administrators to efficiently manage and maintain their instances, making it an invaluable tool for tasks that require consistency and scale across their AWS environment.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  State Management
</h2>

<p>Maintaining consistent configurations across a fleet of instances is a daunting task, especially as your infrastructure grows. Here's where SSM State Manager shines as a beacon of efficiency. It allows sysops administrators to define, enforce, and track configurations across their instances systematically. By creating custom documents or leveraging pre-built ones (like the AWS-managed documents), sysops can specify the desired state of their instances. These documents can cover a wide array of configurations, from security settings to application installations.</p>

<p>When it comes to compliance SSM State Manager plays an integral role in ensuring compliance with organizational standards and industry regulations. It enables sysops to establish configuration baselines that adhere to security best practices. For instance, you can define a baseline configuration that mandates specific firewall rules, software versions, or file permissions. If an instance's configuration ever drifts away from this desired state, SSM State Manager automatically remediates it, bringing it back into compliance. This real-time enforcement minimizes security risks and ensures that instances consistently meet compliance requirements.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Inventory Management
</h2>

<p>Picture SSM as your PA, but for managing your AWS instances. One of its cool tricks is that it can keep track of all your instances and gather information about them - things like their names, IP addresses, operating systems, and more. It's like having a little notebook where it jots down details about all your instances.</p>

<p>Now, why is this handy? Imagine you have a bunch of instances doing different tasks - some for your website, some for databases, and who knows what else. With SSM Inventory Manager, you don't have to go hunting for information about each one individually. You've got it all in one place, organized and easy to find. It's like having a neat inventory of all your IT resources. Plus, when you need to take action, like installing updates or checking security settings, you know exactly which instance is which. SSM makes managing your AWS resources as smooth as a well-organized toolbox.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Automation Documents
</h2>

<p>I just realized I have been making references to automation documents without telling you what they are all about. I apologize for that oversight. Let's examine what they are. Think of Automation Documents as a collection of predefined steps for common tasks, kind of like a recipe for cooking your favourite meal. In the world of sysops, these documents are like secret shortcuts to getting things done quickly and correctly. They're like having an expert sysadmin by your side, guiding you through complex tasks.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you need to create a backup of your EC2 instances regularly. You could write a long list of steps to do it manually, but that's time-consuming and prone to errors. With an Automation Document, you just choose the "Create EC2 Backup" recipe, provide some details like which instances to back up and where to store the backups, and hit "Start." It's like having a magical kitchen gadget that prepares your meal with the push of a button.</p>

<p>But these documents can do much more than backups. They can handle tasks like setting up monitoring, scaling your infrastructure, or even responding to security incidents. So, sysops administrators can save a ton of time and ensure consistency by using these pre-built automation scripts. It's like having a library of superpowers at your fingertips.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Session Management
</h2>

<p>SSM Session Manager offers a secure and auditable way for sysops administrators to remotely access their AWS instances, ensuring both security and transparency in the process. Instead of relying on traditional methods like SSH or RDP, Session Manager establishes a secure, encrypted connection to the instance via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.</p>

<p>Here's how it works: Sysops administrators can initiate a session to an instance directly from the AWS Management Console. Once the session is set up, it's like administrators have taken a virtual seat right in front of the instance, giving them complete control over it. It's almost as if they were there in person, but they can manage everything remotely and securely.</p>

<p>The key advantages are security and auditability. Sessions are logged, providing a detailed record of who accessed which instance, what commands were executed, and when these actions occurred. These logs are invaluable for compliance, troubleshooting, and security investigations, offering transparency into system changes and user activities. Moreover, SSM Session Manager eliminates the need to open inbound ports on instances, reducing the attack surface and enhancing overall security. This centralized and auditable remote access capability is a significant enhancement over traditional access methods like SSH or RDP.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Resource Groups and Tagging
</h2>

<p>Resource groups and tagging are powerful tools in SSM that play a crucial role in organizing and managing instances efficiently within your AWS infrastructure.</p>

<p>Resource groups allow you to create logical collections of AWS resources, including EC2 instances, based on criteria that you define. These criteria can include resource types, tags, and other properties. Utilizing resource groups provides a unified perspective of your assets, simplifying their management and monitoring. For sysops administrators, this means you can create groups based on specific requirements, such as grouping all instances related to a particular application, environment (like development, staging, or production), or business unit. This simplifies the process of locating and accessing instances when performing management tasks.</p>

<p>Tagging is another essential feature that involves attaching metadata (key-value pairs) to AWS resources, like EC2 instances. Sysops administrators can use tags to add custom labels to instances, indicating their purpose, owner, environment, or any other relevant information. Tags streamline the process of classifying and recognizing instances, particularly within extensive environments. SSM leverages these tags and resource groups, allowing sysops teams to target and manage instances based on specific tags or the resource groups they belong to. This streamlined approach ensures that actions taken through SSM are precise and that you can efficiently manage instances based on their intended purpose or role within your infrastructure. Additionally, tags and resource groups enhance visibility and control, facilitating tasks like monitoring, security, and compliance management.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Parameter Store
</h2>

<p>SSM Parameter Store is like a highly secure digital vault for all the critical data that keeps your AWS infrastructure running smoothly. It's like your go-to bank for storing everything from database passwords and API keys to configuration settings and secrets.</p>

<p>Now, here's where it gets handy for sysops: SSM Parameter Store allows you to neatly organize and label your data, much like having labelled folders in a physical filing cabinet. This allows you to maintain a well-organized repository of secrets and configurations, ensuring they are readily accessible when required.</p>

<p>However, there's more to it. SSM Parameter Store enhances security by enabling encryption for your stored data using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Think of it as having a secure, digital lock on each of those folders in your vault. Only those with the right keys can access the information inside.</p>

<p>Sysops professionals can then seamlessly integrate this stored data into their workflows and applications. Need to update a database password for an application? No problem, just fetch it securely from Parameter Store. This ensures that sensitive information remains safe, easily accessible when required, and highly manageable, making the sysops' job much more efficient and secure. It's like having a trusty digital Swiss Army knife for managing sensitive data in your AWS environment.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Integration with Other AWS Services
</h2>

<p>We have covered a lot of ground when it comes to SSM and how sysops professionals can leverage it in performing various actions. However, I still feel like ending this article without talking about SSM's integration with other AWS services won't be nice. With that in mind, here is how SSM integrates with a few AWS services starting with CloudWatch.</p>

<p>SSM and CloudWatch are a dynamic pair for efficient resource management. CloudWatch continuously monitors AWS resources and applications' performance, collecting valuable data and logs. SSM complements this by enabling real-time responses to CloudWatch alarms and events. When a CloudWatch alarm triggers, SSM can swiftly execute commands, run scripts, or initiate specific workflows on managed instances. This synergy ensures proactive management and rapid responses to critical incidents.</p>

<p>SSM also seamlessly integrates with AWS Config, forming a comprehensive resource management and compliance solution. AWS Config records resource configurations and evaluates compliance with your policies. With SSM, you can track historical data and compliance checks for your managed instances. AWS Config Rules define desired resource configurations, while SSM enforces these configurations automatically. This integration helps maintain instances in the desired state and ensures regulatory compliance, enhancing governance and auditing capabilities.</p>

<p>AWS IAM regulates access to AWS resources and pairs effectively with SSM for streamlined access control. By creating finely-tuned IAM policies that specify who can access SSM functionalities and what actions they can perform, you enhance security. The integration ensures that only authorized personnel can interact with managed instances, bolstering the security and compliance posture of your AWS environment.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Last Words
</h2>

<p>En masse, Systems Manager stands as a formidable ally in the realm of sysops administration. Its capabilities, from automating patch management to streamlining command execution, have illuminated a path toward operational efficiency and resource security. As you embark on your journey with SSM, remember that its true power lies not just in its features but in how you harness them to optimize your AWS infrastructure. With SSM by your side, tasks that once seemed daunting become manageable, and you can maintain control and security over your resources effortlessly. So, as you dive into the world of SSM, remember that it's here to simplify your life as a sysops admin. Use it wisely, and you'll find that it's the key to smoother, more secure, and more efficient cloud operations.</p>

 #### - [How to use geolocation api using ReactJS](https://dev.to/choiruladamm/how-to-use-geolocation-api-using-reactjs-ndk) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Geolocation is used to find the current location of a network device. It can be used in applications like Google Maps, Uber, Tripadvisor, etc.</p>

<p>In ReactJS, we can find a user's current geolocation using the JavaScript Geolocation API.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: The Geolocation API is supported in a handful of broswers which can run HTML 5 such as Google Chrome, Opera, Edge, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we will look at the steps that we need to follow in order to use the Geolocation API and find a user's latitude and longitude coordinates.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, we will need to import react and the required libraries that will be used in this implementation. We will use the useState react hook to manage the variable which stores a user's geolocation. We shall add the following line to include these libraries and methods at the start of our program.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li><p>We will declare a component function called App() for our React project, which will load the application page. There we will enclose all the geolocation methods.</p></li>
<li><p>We will declare a component function called App() for our React project, which will load the application page. There we will enclose all the geolocation methods.<br>
</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState(null);
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>The next step is to define a function to find the user's geolocation and update the userLocation variable accordingly. We will use the arrow function shown below.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const getUserLocation = () =&gt; { /*insert code here*/ };
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>In this getUserLocation function, we will now add all the methods for finding the user's geolocation. First, we will check whether the geolocation functionality is supported by the user's browser. We will use a simple if else statement encasing the navigator.geolocation function.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>if (navigator.geolocation) {
    // what to do if supported
}
else {
    // display an error if not supported
    console.error('Geolocation is not supported by this browser.');
}
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>Now, we need to work on what to do if the navigator.geolocation method is supported by the user's browser. We will need to retrieve the user's location. To do this, we use the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() function.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (position) =&gt; {
        // what to do once we have the position
    },
    (error) =&gt; {
        // display an error if we cant get the users position
        console.error('Error getting user location:', error);
    }
);
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>Once we have the position of the user, we can now use it to find the user's coordinates and other relevant data. To access the coordinates that are enclosed in the position variable, we can use the poisiton.coords method. We will now create two variables to store these coordinates for later use.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>Once we have access to the user's coordinates, we will now update our userLocation variable by calling the setUserLocation() function.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>setUserLocation({ latitude, longitude });
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>Now that we have stored the user's location coordinates, our next job is to render an HTML that will reflect back the user's coordinates onto the web page. To do this, we will include a button, and when its clicked, we will call the getUserLocation function and update the userLocation variable.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>&lt;button onClick={getUserLocation}&gt;Get User Location&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

</div>



<ul>
<li>We must also display the user location if we retrieve it successfully. To do this, we will use a &amp;&amp; statement along with the userLocation variable, which encloses all the HTML code to print the user's coordinates. Once the userLocation variable updates, it is no longer a null value, and the statement is now true; hence it displays the coordinates.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>{userLocation &amp;&amp; (
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;User Location&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Latitude: {userLocation.latitude}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Longitude: {userLocation.longitude}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
)}
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Now that we have gone through all the steps that we need to follow to retrieve a user's geographical location, we will now combine all the steps into a single file.</p>

  Data Communication:
</h2>

<p>Data communication, also known as data networking or network communication, refers to the transmission of digital data between devices or systems over a network. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and telecommunications and plays a crucial role in enabling communication and data exchange in today's interconnected world. Here are key aspects and components of data communication:</p>

<p><strong>1. Data Transmission Medium</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Media</strong>: Data can be transmitted over various physical mediums, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Copper Wire</strong>: Used in Ethernet and telephone connections.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fiber Optic Cable</strong>: Provides high-speed and long-distance data transmission.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wireless</strong>: Radio waves, microwaves, and satellite links are used for wireless communication.</li>
<li>
<strong>Coaxial Cable</strong>: Often used for cable television and some data networks.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li><p><strong>Wireless Technologies</strong>: Wireless data communication includes Wi-Fi, cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G), Bluetooth, and satellite communication.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Data Transmission Methods</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Serial vs. Parallel</strong>: Data can be transmitted serially (one bit at a time) or in parallel (multiple bits simultaneously).</li>
<li>
<strong>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</strong>: In synchronous transmission, data is sent in synchronized frames, while asynchronous transmission does not require strict synchronization.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Network Protocols and Standards</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Protocols</strong>: Network protocols define rules and conventions for data communication. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Standards</strong>: Standards organizations like the IEEE, ISO, and ITU develop specifications for networking and communication technologies, ensuring interoperability.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Network Topologies</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Physical Topology</strong>: Describes the physical layout of devices in a network, such as star, bus, ring, or mesh topologies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Logical Topology</strong>: Defines how data flows in the network, often based on protocols (e.g., Ethernet, Token Ring).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Network Devices</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Routers</strong>: Devices that connect different networks and route data between them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Switches</strong>: Devices that forward data within a local network based on MAC addresses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Firewalls</strong>: Network security devices that filter incoming and outgoing traffic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modems</strong>: Devices that modulate and demodulate signals to enable digital data transmission over analog lines (e.g., DSL modems).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6. Network Layers</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>OSI Model</strong>: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines seven layers, each responsible for specific functions in data communication. These layers include physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application layers.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Transmission Modes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Simplex</strong>: Data flows in one direction only (e.g., TV broadcast).</li>
<li>
<strong>Half-Duplex</strong>: Data can flow in both directions but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).</li>
<li>
<strong>Full-Duplex</strong>: Data can flow in both directions simultaneously (e.g., phone conversation).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8. Error Detection and Correction</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Techniques like checksums and error-correcting codes are used to detect and correct errors in transmitted data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>9. Data Encoding and Modulation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data is often encoded into electrical, optical, or radio wave signals for transmission. Techniques like modulation are used to represent digital data in analog signals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>10. Network Security and Encryption</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data communication often involves security measures to protect data from unauthorized access and eavesdropping. Encryption and secure protocols are used for secure communication.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>11. Bandwidth and Data Rate</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bandwidth represents the capacity of a communication channel, while data rate refers to the speed at which data is transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>12. Data Routing</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data is routed through networks using routing algorithms and tables that determine the best path from the source to the destination.</li>
</ul>

<p>Data communication is the foundation of the internet, telecommunication networks, and various other communication systems. It enables the exchange of information, multimedia content, and real-time interactions across the globe, impacting various aspects of modern life, from business and education to entertainment and healthcare.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Application Layer:
</h2>

<p>The application layer is one of the seven layers in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and one of the five layers in the TCP/IP model. It is the topmost layer in both models and plays a fundamental role in network communication, as it focuses on end-user services and applications. Here's an overview of the application layer:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vkG17HvF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/opg7tsvapbmdpcssq9fj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--vkG17HvF--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/opg7tsvapbmdpcssq9fj.png" alt="Image description" width="585" height="359"></a></p>

<p><strong>Key Functions of the Application Layer</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>End-User Services</strong>: The primary purpose of the application layer is to provide various network services directly to end-users or applications. It acts as an interface between the network and the user, ensuring that applications can communicate over the network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Protocols</strong>: The application layer defines various protocols and standards for specific applications and services to communicate with one another. These protocols determine how data is formatted, transmitted, and received by applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Presentation and Translation</strong>: The application layer is responsible for data presentation and conversion. It ensures that data is in a format that the receiving application can understand and interpret. This includes tasks like data encryption, compression, and character set conversion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Session Management</strong>: The application layer can establish, maintain, and terminate communication sessions between applications. It helps manage the flow of data and ensures that information is synchronized between sender and receiver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Identification and Addressing</strong>: The application layer defines mechanisms for identifying applications and services on a network, typically using port numbers or other identifiers. This enables routers and switches to forward data to the appropriate destination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Some application layer protocols and services handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources or services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File Transfer and Remote Access</strong>: Protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and SSH (Secure Shell) operate at the application layer and enable file transfer and remote access to servers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Email Services</strong>: Email protocols such as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending emails and POP3/IMAP for receiving emails operate at the application layer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Web Services</strong>: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), used for web browsing and web-based applications, is a key application layer protocol.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Examples of Application Layer Protocols and Services</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>HTTP/HTTPS</strong>: Hypertext Transfer Protocol and its secure version are used for web browsing and web services.</li>
<li>
<strong>SMTP</strong>: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used for sending email.</li>
<li>
<strong>POP3/IMAP</strong>: Post Office Protocol and Internet Message Access Protocol are used for receiving email.</li>
<li>
<strong>FTP</strong>: File Transfer Protocol is used for transferring files.</li>
<li>
<strong>SSH</strong>: Secure Shell is used for secure remote access and management of network devices.</li>
<li>
<strong>DNS</strong>: Domain Name System resolves domain names into IP addresses.</li>
<li>
<strong>SNMP</strong>: Simple Network Management Protocol is used for managing and monitoring network devices.</li>
<li>
<strong>TELNET</strong>: Used for remote terminal access (not secure).</li>
</ul>

<p>The application layer is critical for enabling communication between different software applications and services across a network. It provides the necessary abstractions and protocols to facilitate this communication, ensuring that data is exchanged accurately and efficiently.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Network Protocols:
</h2>

<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are fundamental protocols in computer networking that play essential roles in data communication and web services. Each protocol serves a specific purpose and has its characteristics and use cases. Here's an overview of each:<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RKMceQE8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0l6a19qac8dhho1l3sj.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RKMceQE8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b0l6a19qac8dhho1l3sj.png" alt="Image description" width="697" height="537"></a></p>

<p><strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: HTTP is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypertext (text-based documents with links) and other data between a client (typically a web browser) and a web server.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Request-Response Model: HTTP follows a client-server model where a client sends requests to a web server, and the server responds with the requested content.</li>
<li>Stateless: HTTP is stateless, meaning each request-response cycle is independent, and the server doesn't retain information about previous requests from the same client.</li>
<li>Connectionless: By default, HTTP uses a connectionless model where each request/response is a separate connection. However, HTTP/1.1 introduced the option to reuse connections (HTTP Keep-Alive) for multiple requests.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used for browsing websites, fetching resources like HTML pages, images, videos, and interacting with web services through APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, connection-oriented, and stream-oriented data communication between two devices in a network.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Reliable: TCP ensures the reliable delivery of data by acknowledging received packets, retransmitting lost packets, and ordering received packets.</li>
<li>Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection before data exchange and terminates the connection after communication.</li>
<li>Stream-Oriented: TCP treats data as a continuous stream of bytes, providing a byte-stream interface to applications.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Use Cases</strong>: TCP is commonly used for applications where data reliability and ordering are critical, such as web browsing, email, file transfer (e.g., FTP), and remote access (e.g., SSH).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: UDP is a transport layer protocol that provides a connectionless and lightweight method for sending datagrams (packets) of data between devices in a network.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Connectionless: UDP does not establish a connection before sending data and does not guarantee the delivery or ordering of data packets.</li>
<li>Lightweight: UDP has lower overhead compared to TCP because it lacks features like flow control and error correction.</li>
<li>Low Latency: UDP is preferred for real-time applications where low latency is crucial, such as VoIP, online gaming, and multimedia streaming.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: UDP is suitable for applications where real-time communication is more important than data integrity, such as video conferencing, DNS, DHCP, and various real-time protocols.
Remote Procedure Call (RPC), gRPC, REST, and GraphQL are all protocols and technologies used for building APIs and enabling communication between clients and servers in distributed systems. Each of these technologies has its own characteristics and use cases. Here's an in-depth explanation of each:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: RPC is a protocol that allows a program or function to execute code on a remote server or service as if it were a local function call. It abstracts the complexities of network communication, making it appear as if the client is invoking a function on the server.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Synchronous: RPC calls are typically synchronous, meaning the client waits for the remote procedure to complete and return a response.</li>
<li>Language Agnostic: RPC can work across different programming languages, allowing clients and servers to be written in different languages.</li>
<li>Communication Overhead: RPC may involve serialization/deserialization of data and network communication, which can add overhead.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: RPC is commonly used in scenarios where you need direct control over remote services and want to make remote calls feel like local calls. Examples include remote method invocation in Java RMI and gRPC.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>gRPC</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: gRPC is an open-source RPC framework developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 as the transport protocol and Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as the interface definition language (IDL) to define services and message structures.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Strongly Typed: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define APIs and data structures, providing strong typing and code generation.</li>
<li>Language Agnostic: Similar to RPC, gRPC allows communication between clients and servers implemented in different programming languages.</li>
<li>Bidirectional Streaming: gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, enabling both clients and servers to send multiple messages in a single RPC.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: gRPC is well-suited for building efficient and performant APIs in microservices architectures. It's commonly used in scenarios where high performance, strong typing, and bidirectional communication are important.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>REST (Representational State Transfer)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is based on a set of principles and constraints that define how resources are identified and addressed via URLs, and how they can be manipulated using a limited set of standardized HTTP methods.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Stateless: RESTful services are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.</li>
<li>CRUD Operations: REST maps CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for resource manipulation.</li>
<li>Representations: Resources in REST can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML), and clients can specify their preferred representation.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: REST is widely used for building APIs on the web, including web services, social media APIs, and any scenario where stateless communication over HTTP is appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GraphQL</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong>: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need and nothing more. It provides a flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval and manipulation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Characteristics</strong>:

<ul>
<li>Flexible Queries: Clients can specify exactly what data they need in their queries, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.</li>
<li>Strongly Typed: GraphQL APIs are strongly typed and introspective, meaning the schema is self-documenting, and clients can discover available operations and types.</li>
<li>Single Endpoint: GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint for all API operations, making it easier to manage and optimize.</li>
</ul>


</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Cases</strong>: GraphQL is suitable for scenarios where clients have diverse data needs, need to reduce over-fetching of data, or want to consolidate multiple API endpoints into a single endpoint. It is often used in modern web and mobile app development.</li>
</ul>

  Preface
</h2>

<p>Hello everyone, welcome to the <code>Useless Innovation</code> technology channel. That's right! You read that right, here is a combination of useless technologies or technologies that are rarely touched in daily life. Innovate a more useless tool and provide it for everyone to use. Therefore, we call it <code>useless innovation</code>, or we can also call it <code>berry innovation</code>.</p>

<p>Before explaining my development and learning process, I will first share the tools with everyone. If you want to know more about us or want to learn and cooperate, you can send me a private message. Quick access addressÔºö<a href="http://meichuang.org.cn/meichuangToos/#/index">http://meichuang.org.cn/meichuangToos/#/index</a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  front page
</h2>

<p>When you enter the homepage of the platform, you can see a very simple style, which is mainly divided into three areas: the header area, the introduction area, and the functional module area. What we developed this time: the ‚Äúuseless‚Äù static code generator tool is our first product, also known as Pixel Partner.</p>

<p>*When I chose this name, I wanted this tool to be your partner in the development process. It can help you complete the task of cutting pictures at any time, so that you are no longer a picture cutting boy. *</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIPKnLDx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rryzsqgdyk5924vb3odm.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TIPKnLDx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rryzsqgdyk5924vb3odm.png" alt="home" width="800" height="444"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Pixel Partner
</h2>

<p>When you enter the Pixel Partner tool, you will be asked by default to upload a PSD mockup first. After the upload is completed, it will help you with cutting, rendering and other actions, and finally enter the console.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XntJ4RLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m925bybdk8chtbiay5h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XntJ4RLI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1m925bybdk8chtbiay5h.png" alt="import" width="800" height="445"></a></p>

<p><strong>The console page is divided into three modules:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>File preview area on the left: You can upload multiple psds and switch at any time.</li>
<li>The page preview area in the middle: preview the corresponding psd interface.</li>
<li>Ribbon on the right: Set the configuration of download code.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lt_tmprU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nl3foqy1ireaatqgt02m.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lt_tmprU--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nl3foqy1ireaatqgt02m.png" alt="preview" width="800" height="446"></a></p>

<p>Mainly explain the functions of the functional area:</p>

<ol>
<li>Source code type: Generate code using the syntax and rules of the corresponding type. Contains HTML, Vue2.x, React, Uniapp, WeChat applet</li>
<li>Size standard: The page adapts to the size. According to the value you fill in, all the elements of the page are generated to the corresponding adapted size, so that they can be perfectly presented on the page.</li>
<li>Unit standard: According to the size and unit, it can be adapted to the display of different clients. Contains PX, REM, VH, VW</li>
<li>Font: Upload the corresponding text font to restore the visual draft.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eul0SFSp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lf9n6tfcta4r9molrz8d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eul0SFSp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lf9n6tfcta4r9molrz8d.png" alt="ribbon" width="800" height="1520"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Self-test
</h2>

<p>After the development was completed, we also conducted self-tests for a period of time to summarize the overall integrity of the current website.</p>

<ol>
<li>Parse poster-related PSD files, which can be perfectly parsed, as long as the corresponding font file is uploaded (<strong>This is very important</strong>). Our company is also using it now, which basically saves one or two people‚Äôs working hours (the boss is very satisfied).</li>
<li>The layout is not strong, and it is not very friendly to the management backend or daily business viewing pages. The current overall layout is based on positioning and has no structure. We are constantly making breakthroughs in this regard (<strong>If you have the ability and interest in this area People can join our small team, and we can open source in this area</strong>)</li>
<li>The recognition is not strong and cannot be recognized as input boxes, tables, icons, etc. We are also looking for a breakthrough point for this. To be honest, it is a bit difficult. There is no one in this field (<strong>If anyone is willing to teach us how to train large models, please send me a private message, or if you are willing to cooperate</strong>)</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  Summarize
</h2>

<p>The above introduction ends here. The operation is very simple, and the function of generating page code is also very nice. Everyone can try it. Maybe it will be helpful to you, <code>I introduced this tool to a friend, and he directly used it to take orders to develop pages. He complained that he could borrow more orders for drawing static pages.</code>I secretly envy people who have private contracts. That‚Äôs it for this issue, see you next time.</p>
