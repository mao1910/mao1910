 #### - [Picnic-TUI - Where Go and Groceries Create a Command-Line Feast](https://dev.to/simonmartyr/picnic-tui-where-go-and-groceries-create-a-command-line-feast-1op4) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>During some downtime I decided I would really like to try to learn Go. It was a language I had some exposure to in past client projects, and my coworkers who used it gave it glowing reviews. Some of which were even using it for side projects, such as doing analytics on property prices in the area through the use of web scrapers. Something which is very useful in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt initially have a real goal or use case for the language but that didn‚Äôt hold me back from giving it a shot. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  My learning route
</h2>

<p>When learning any new programming language I like to approach it in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn the basics of the syntax and get a feel for the language.</li>
<li>Try out some basic algorithms - solve some leet code problems.
</li>
<li>Make a basic to-do app.</li>
<li>Enhance that app work to work with a database or HTTP endpoint etc.</li>
<li>Build more silly apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Like most beginners, I started with the <a href="https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1">a tour of go</a> and got a quick feel for the language. I feel all languages should copy a tour of go as its a delightful introduction to the language which builds confidence quickly.</p>

<p>I continued with my learning plan </p>

<ul>
<li>Invert a binary tree on leet code.</li>
<li>Made a basic to-do app.</li>
<li>Remade it to work with Gin and SQL.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Step 5 build more silly apps
</h2>

<p>In the words of Ben Davis: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqdBixi_y1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqdBixi_y1s</a> </p>

<p>Just build stuff.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  A web scraper
</h3>

<p>Inspired by my coworker‚Äôs web scraper project and Claud‚Äôs <a href="https://dev.to/claudbytes/build-a-web-scraper-with-go-3jod">Article</a>. I made a basic web scraper app to perform silly analytics on my company‚Äôs website. To answer questions such as: </p>

<ul>
<li>Who has the longest profile description?</li>
<li>What is the frequency of the different job titles?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T42kxL3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlcth6nwez7mad5nthrb.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--T42kxL3R--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mlcth6nwez7mad5nthrb.jpg" alt="Graph results of the scraper" width="650" height="403"></a></p>

<p>Credit to the package <a href="https://github.com/daoleno/tgraph">tgraph</a> for giving me the ability to draw these cool graphs in the terminal with the results.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Pokemon CLI
</h3>

<p>It was at this point I was getting a lot of joy out of writing command line applications. I had also just learnt of the existence of <a href="https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui">spotify-tui</a> and wanted to explore more I could build such applications. So building interfaces for APIs felt like a good way to try this out. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://pokeapi.co">PokeApi</a> is a resource I like to use whilst getting familiar with making HTTP calls in a new language. So I threw together such a simple app to leverage all the various methods the API offered.  </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Time to do the groceries
</h2>

<p>In between learning Go I got curious if there was an API for the app I use for doing my groceries? I am an avid user of the Picnic, Picnic is an online supermarket who operate in Europe. Customers of Picnic do so exclusively via their mobile application.  </p>

<p>However the thought crossed my mind, what if I could automate aspects of my weekly shop? Something like a script that pre-loads my basket in advance, that could be useful.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me I came across <a href="https://github.com/MRVDH/picnic-api/">https://github.com/MRVDH/picnic-api/</a> an unofficial Node.js package for the picnic API. This was perfect, I made a few scripts using the node module mission accomplished.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Enter Picnic-TUI
</h3>

<p>Now that I got a taste of what I could do with the Picnic API the natural follow up was to make a wrapper for the API and terminal user interface in Go.</p>

<p>The goal in my mind at this point being, if at any point in the day, I want to add something to my order I could do so from the comfort of my terminal and not have to reach for my phone. This is not a bash at Picnic‚Äôs mobile app, I simply wanted to reduce the distraction which is my phone.</p>

<p>Picture it, you are writing code in your favourite terminal based text editor (lets say neovim) and you are  configuring a new Spring bean. It is in this moment you remember you need beans. Simple you hit <code>:term</code> run <code>picnic-tui</code> add them straight to your basket and get back into the code. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  The API
</h2>

<p>Using the documentation from <a href="https://github.com/MRVDH/picnic-api/">https://github.com/MRVDH/picnic-api/</a>  this allowed me to produce the base for a Go wrapper <a href="https://github.com/simonmartyr/picnic-api">https://github.com/simonmartyr/picnic-api</a>. </p>

<p>At this point I had the functionalities for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authenticating</li>
<li>Getting user information</li>
<li>Searching for products</li>
<li>Adjusting the cart</li>
<li>Selecting delivery slots</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  
  
  Sniffing the rest
</h3>

<p>At this point I was really satisfied with everything I could do with the API. But I wanted to try and make a more complete experience. Would it be possible to finalise an order? How would the payment flow go?</p>

<p>As I mentioned I had expended all the knowledge I had acquired from the Node library so that left me with one option. Intercepting all the outgoing requires from my phone to Picnic to learn all of the APIs I had not captured.</p>

<p>To accomplish this I used the tool <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">https://www.charlesproxy.com</a>. Conveniently Charles Proxy also has an iOS application which allowed me intercept all outgoing request from my iPhone.   </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_F0An0dR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/45brpus2abe2g32oi6yh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--_F0An0dR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/45brpus2abe2g32oi6yh.png" alt="Charles screenshot" width="300" height="522"></a></p>

<p>This gave me all the information I needed to identify the endpoints and payloads I would need to succeed my goal. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  A note on the authentication parts
</h2>

<p>I found it curious and would welcome any response if any Picnic developers happen to be reading. When a client authenticates with the API they send the user‚Äôs username and password as well as a client id. The detail I found interesting was the password needs to be MD5 hashed prior to being sent. I‚Äôm curious as to why, and curious if that MD5 hashed password is persisted as is or additionally encrypted.</p>

<p>Upon a successful authentication, a JWT is issued which can then be used as a header for endpoints which require authentication. A behaviour I did observer however is, the tokens specify an expiration time (of one day), but the server continues to accept expired tokens.</p>

<p>I believe the intention is that clients would persist the users credentials on device in a secure enclave. Likely storing the MD5 hashed password rather than in plain text. Each day or when it believes its token has expired the application calls the authentication endpoint to get a new one.</p>

<p>Ideally the tokens do not continue to live, as if a token did fall into the wrong hands, that person would continue to have access and the real user would be none the wiser.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Time to checkout
</h3>

<p>Prior to intercepting the http requests the checkout flow was unknown to me. From observing the endpoints I learnt that at the moment a user invokes a checkout request the API performs the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request to start the checkout.</li>
<li>If articles in the cart produce an error (such as alcohol) prompt user (ask if user is 18+).</li>
<li>Upon successful confirmation a request is sent to start the checkout again with the relevant resolve key.</li>
<li>At this point a request for payment can be initiated which returns a payment link for the customer to complete their payment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the payment being simply an ideal link, I wanted to explore if I could render a QR code in the terminal to complete an order.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The TUI
</h2>

<p>With my API library complete, it was time to set my focus on producing a terminal UI. My inspiration was to replicate the feel of Spotify-TUI. The interface of Spotify-TUI was simple but effective in its implementation. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9GtEiHGf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b06jacoh7025qfiudy7m.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9GtEiHGf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/b06jacoh7025qfiudy7m.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Spotify-tui" width="800" height="362"></a></p>

<p>The interface combined multiple intractable views in which the user can navigate the core functionality of Spotify. This application adjusted my expectations on what a terminal based ui could achieve. </p>

<p>Additionally I had an appreciation for the detail to include vim motions in many aspects of their interface for example ‚Äò/‚Äô to search, the option to use ‚Äòh‚Äô, ‚Äòj‚Äô, ‚Äòk‚Äô, ‚Äòl‚Äô in place of arrow keys. From top to bottom the developers demonstrate a lot of passion and care.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Picnic Application
</h3>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fo5WY8Qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ecgpmzhtyq3y40dbcd9d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Fo5WY8Qi--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ecgpmzhtyq3y40dbcd9d.png" alt="Screen shots of the picnic app" width="800" height="515"></a></p>

<p>The images above show screenshots from the Picnic mobile application. Typically a user would search the application for different articles of food they wish to have delivered and add them to their basket. When they are satisfied with their selection, the user schedules a delivery date and pays for the order. When the time comes around for the oder to be delivered, the application can even show the route the driver is taking, so they are aware as to what time their delivery should arrive.</p>

<p>Within my application, I wanted to only support the functionality to create an order. Rendering the route information of the ongoing delivery would be very cool, but for my needs didn‚Äôt add value.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Evolution of the screens
</h3>

<p>Spotify-TUI was developed in Rust, therefore I couldn‚Äôt simply use the same UI framework. Within Go a popular choice is tview <a href="https://github.com/rivo/tview">https://github.com/rivo/tview</a>  which provides many similar UI widgets which covered all my needs.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Ocz6CwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r58n123o6otyyxa4g5ta.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2Ocz6CwB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/r58n123o6otyyxa4g5ta.jpg" alt="first version of screens" width="800" height="177"></a></p>

<p>I initially started with the main screen. I wanted to explore how much I could do with the product searching and manipulating the basket. </p>

<p>It was surprising to me how simple it was to get the barebones going. One widget I relied on heavily in tview was flex views. They work similar to flex boxs in the web world, where you can add a collection of different views into a flex view and those widgets would be arranged and sized correctly.<br>

<p>When you add an item to flex view, you can instruct to tview if that item has a fixed size or the proportions of the view and if that view should be focused (meaning the screen highlights that view making it listen to interactions). </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Main Page
</h3>

<p>One idea that I had with the main page that I was curious to pull off was, how would I see the products in the terminal?</p>

<p>tview included an image widget that required a reference to an image. So within the API I wrote a method to query the image url and pass the response body through a png decoder and see what happens.<br>

<p>Success, I could see what peanut butter looks like in the terminal. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QT2xVNSo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3cn3okm0p0n34fvn6i8.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QT2xVNSo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/d3cn3okm0p0n34fvn6i8.jpg" alt="rendering of screen with product image" width="800" height="168"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Delivery Page
</h3>

<p>I attempted initially to have the delivery slots as a dynamic element that appeared on the main page. However this felt clunky and overall a bad end user experience.  </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6pbZ_OZ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/95nkdatdtrkvtn4x4mtc.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6pbZ_OZ_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/95nkdatdtrkvtn4x4mtc.jpg" alt="first delivery screen" width="291" height="347"></a></p>

<p>My first iteration of the delivery view was to create a list of all the slot with an item highlighted when the day changed. It felt natural at this point to move this content into its own page by leveraging the tview pages widget. </p>

<p>This widget allows you to set different views as a page within your application and dynamically switch to them when needed. </p>

<p>For the delivery page I experimented with the idea to generate content into a flex view. The idea was simple, each time there was a new day, create a new list of options and add that to a growing flex view. </p>

<p>The API only returned the possible delivery slots for the next seven days, so I knew it shouldn‚Äôt grow out of control.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bwpIsBjv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88u46bpcboipcsb81yy2.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--bwpIsBjv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/88u46bpcboipcsb81yy2.jpg" alt="better delivery screen" width="800" height="210"></a></p>

<p>With the experiment a success, I cleaned up the view by not having all lists look like they were being interacted with at the same time. Additionally I highlighted which slot was currently selected and which were the more environmental options.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rzQ1WV2I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2e73tfv76tqoboq1zpk.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rzQ1WV2I--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c2e73tfv76tqoboq1zpk.jpg" alt="styled delivery screen" width="800" height="208"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Checkout Page
</h3>

<p>The checkout page was fun, because as mentioned above there is a sequence of events in order to complete the order. </p>

<p>The biggest part of the puzzle was, how would I render the payment QR code? </p>

<p>Luckily the library <a href="https://github.com/skip2/go-qrcode">https://github.com/skip2/go-qrcode</a> allowed for a QR code to be generated as a string allowing that string to be presented inside a text view.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight go"><code><span class="k">func</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">CheckoutPage</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">renderPaymentLink</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span> <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P_tGf_CQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/un09dkbcbu6qppbsjg3u.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--P_tGf_CQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/un09dkbcbu6qppbsjg3u.jpg" alt="checkout page with qr" width="800" height="174"></a></p>

<p>The other challenge inside the checkout page was to present different checks and errors based on the content of the cart. </p>

<p>Within the API, I decided that errors produced by the checkout should be wrapped in their own error object allowing for the page to dynamically handle them. </p>

<p>For example, if the cart contains alcohol, the user is instructed to confirm they are 18+ or if they haven‚Äôt met the minimum order price modals are presented to the user with directions of what to do. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3VZ1sUjz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/spur988uj3oejhfx19b0.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3VZ1sUjz--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/spur988uj3oejhfx19b0.jpg" alt="checkout page warning" width="800" height="174"></a></p>

<p>If all actions are successfully resolved the screen presents the QR code allowing for the completion of the order.  </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Final words

<p>I reached my goal and successfully made a complete order and had my perfect cli tool to manage my groceries. </p>

<p>More importantly it gave me a great platform to experiment and learn more about Go. This experience really reenforced to me if you can find something that gives you joy to build your learning will go faster and you will get more out of it. </p>

<p>Software debugging can often feel like a never-ending maze. Just when you think you're on the right track, you hit a dead-end. But, by employing the age-old technique of the process of elimination, and using the analogy of the 'Tong Motion,' we can navigate this maze more effectively.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Understanding the Process of Elimination in Debugging
</h2>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Basics
</h3>

<p>The process of elimination in debugging is straightforward in principle: continuously rule out non-problematic components until the root cause reveals itself. This can be achieved either by commenting out lines of code or using debugging techniques, such as the 'force return', which bypasses specific code paths.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Using External Tools
</h3>

<p>For front-end issues, replicating the problem using tools like curl or postman is valuable. It helps us determine if the bug is within the front-end code or elsewhere. This way, we can quickly narrow our focus, not merely addressing the symptoms but locating the actual bug.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Power of Unit Tests in Debugging
</h2>

<p>Unit tests are our best allies when it comes to debugging. By focusing on isolated units, they hone in on potential problem areas.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Benefits of Mocking Frameworks
</h3>

<p>Mocking frameworks like Mockito come in handy as they can simulate large parts of the application. This way, we can drill down on the exact problem, circumventing potential disturbances. Moreover, using mocks can prevent regression and make our test cases cleaner.</p>

<p>However, while there are best practices regarding the extent of mocking, when debugging a specific problem, it's more pragmatic to mock as much as necessary to distill the problem to its essence.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Challenges with Flaky Issues
</h2>

<p>The elimination technique is less straightforward with flaky issues - those bugs that appear irregularly or whose behavior changes as code is eliminated. The key strategy here is to <strong>focus on negatives</strong>. In simpler terms, if removing a certain block doesn't cause the problem to appear, it doesn't automatically indict that block. The absence could be due to the bug's unpredictable nature. Hence, it's crucial only to trust instances where the problem consistently reproduces.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Concept of the 'Tong Motion'
</h2>

<p>Think of tongs. They grasp from both sides. Similarly, almost all software has at least two primary interfaces or points of input/output. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enterprise Web Apps</strong>: Web UI on one side and the database on the other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating System Kernel</strong>: User space app on one end and computer hardware on the other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video Games</strong>: The joystick and screen API on one side and the game database on the other.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Applying the Tong Motion to Debugging
</h3>

<p>Using the example of an enterprise web app:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Mocking the Web Tier</strong>: Begin by using tools like curl or postman to eliminate front-end issues.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mocking the Database</strong>: Replace the actual database with mock data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Narrowing Down Further</strong>: If the problem persists, move to testing the presentation tier directly, thereby eliminating the database from the equation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digging Deeper</strong>: Invoke the business method directly and mock its dependencies. This way, you are narrowing down on the actual method causing the issue while excluding the rest of the application.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One common pitfall is neglecting one prong of the tongs or misplacing the other. It's crucial to ensure both sides are appropriately positioned; otherwise, it might skew the results. If stuck, consider investigating from the opposite side, and then revert when needed.</p>

<p><a></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  An Illustrative Case: Debugging a Server Performance Issue
</h2>

<p>In a real-world scenario, while tackling a server performance issue, I employed the 'Tong Motion' technique. By replacing web calls with curl requests, I shifted focus to the problematic area. At the same time, I enhanced database logging to monitor its output as problematic SQL was replicated through curl. This dual-sided approach helped unearth a bug in the Object Relational Mapping layer.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8rLSjHV3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m121zs8x7buo7ulnxqgs.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8rLSjHV3--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/m121zs8x7buo7ulnxqgs.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="403"></a></p>

<p>This concrete example comprises of the following stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The tongs start by mocking the web tier with curl or postman. This eliminates front-end related issues.</p>

<p>The other side of the tong motion replaces the database with mock data.¬†¬†</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the issue can be reproduced we can further squeeze the tongs by invoking the presentation tier method directly in a test case.<br><br>
We can then eliminate the database entirely from the equation by mocking it in a test case.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we can invoke the business method directly eliminating the presentation tier aspect.<br><br>
We can mock its dependencies which means we narrow down on a specific method that‚Äôs at fault while eliminating the rest of the application.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Wrapping Up
</h2>

<p>Debugging can be a daunting process. However, with the right techniques, like the process of elimination and the 'Tong Motion' approach, it becomes a more manageable task. Always remember to tackle issues methodically and from all angles to find and fix the root cause effectively.</p>

<p>Abstract: Once we press the merge button that code is no longer our responsibility. If it performs sub-optimally or has a bug it is now the problem of the DevOps team, the SRE, etc. Unfortunately, those teams work with a different toolset. If my code uses up too much RAM they will increase RAM. If the code runs slower they will increase CPU. If the code crashes they will increase concurrent instances.</p>

<p>If none of that helps they will call you up at 2AM. A lot of these problems are visible before they become a disastrous middle of the night call. Yes. DevOps should control production, but the information they gather from production is useful for all of us.</p>

 #### - [you may need this - bash script](https://dev.to/scorcism/you-may-need-this-bash-script-p0e) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>I created a bash script for handling</p>

<p><code>git add.</code>, <code>git commit -m ""</code> and <code>git push</code></p>

<p>Don't ask why,<br>
Yes, I will tell<br>
For a developer, these 3 commands are the most important to work on on a daily basis.</p>

<p>But it's a little bit time-consuming‚Äînot much, but 2 seconds, I can say.</p>

<p>So I created this script.<br>
Follow me.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  Create a file
</h3>


<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>vim gitpush.sh
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>
  
  
  The <strong>Code</strong>
</h3>


<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>
git add <span class="nb">.</span>
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">"</span>
git push
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>Each line explanation: </p>

<p><code>#! -&gt; bash shebang</code></p>

<p>git add . -&gt; add all the files to staging</p>

<p>git commit -m "" -&gt; write changes permanently.</p>

<p>git push -&gt; push to the remote origin.</p>
<h3>
  
  
  Exit <strong>the vim</strong>
</h3>
<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>a. Enter `Esc`

b. Enter `:`

c: Enter `wq`

![exit vim](https://imgur.com/XA9IOdC.png)
</code></pre>

</div>
<p>The entire file should be like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LCDqXDx0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://imgur.com/PglpMBb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LCDqXDx0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://imgur.com/PglpMBb.png" alt="entire process" width="644" height="396"></a></p>

<p>Now we need to give execute permission to the file.<br>
Follow the command.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">chmod </span>700 gitpush.sh
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Command breakdown<br>
chmod: This is used to change the file permissions.<br>
700: 700 is divided into 3 groups: a) 7, b) 0, and c) 0.</p>

<p><strong>a</strong>) refers to the current user.<br>
<strong>b</strong>) refers to the group<br>
<strong>c</strong>) refers to other users in the system.</p>

<p>Group <strong>a</strong> is 7, which means the current user has all the permissions. You can understand this by</p>

<p>[<br>
  4: for read,<br>
  2 for write,<br>
  1 for execute<br>
  ]</p>

<p>So, 7 = 4 + 2 + 1, so the current user will have all the permissions.</p>

<p>0 means no permissions.</p>

<p>The entire steps will look like:</p>

<p>As you can see, I have used the absolute path of the file with just the commit message. Liek simple.</p>

<p>But, <br>
In bash, we can use alias to avoid typing the file path every time.</p>

<p>Follow me:</p>
<h3>
  
  
  Go to the Home directory
</h3>


<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>
  
  
  Open your shell script; I'm using zsh.
</h3>


<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>vim .zshrc
</code></pre>

</div>


<p>If you are using bash, it must be <code>.bashrc</code>. You can check that by<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  The core command
</h3>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">alias</span> <span class="nt">-g</span> <span class="nv">gitpush</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">'/home/scor32k/blogs/scripts/gitpush.sh $1'</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>restart the shell (close the terminal and open again). This will globally set the alias.</p>

 #### - [Our Team's Favourite Open Source Projects Right Now](https://dev.to/rigdev/our-teams-favourite-open-source-projects-right-now-4jlc) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>At Rig.dev, we love open source. It's not just about writing code; it's about sharing solutions, solving problems - all as a community. We asked everyone on our team to show their current favourite open source project. Why? Because we're always on the hunt for cool tools and we thought you might be too.</p>

<p>The answers we got are all over the map, and that's what makes this so interesting. Some of us are into hardcore frameworks, while others are vibing with smaller, simpler projects that solve everyday challenges. Either way, we're stoked about these open source projects that are making our lives easier and we think you might find a few new favourites in this list too.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  A humble favor ü§ó:
</h2>

<p>I'm on a mission to reach 1k stars for Rig.dev. Would you consider supporting by giving it a star on Github? It encourages me and the rest of the team to produce new, high-quality content weekly.</p>

<p>OpenTF is a fork of Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to safely and efficiently build, change, and version infrastructure. OpenTF is still under development, but it aims to be a fully open-source, community-driven alternative to Terraform.</p>

<p>The origin of OpenTF is the Terraform OSS community's concern over HashiCorp's decision to switch the Terraform license from the Apache 2.0 license to the Business Source License (BSL). The BSL is a more restrictive license that could make it more difficult for organizations to use Terraform in certain circumstances.</p>

 #### - [NestJS: Bun vs NodeJS](https://dev.to/mourishitz/running-nestjs-server-with-bun-4cdl) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  What is Bun?
</h2>

<p>Bun JS or Bun Sh is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript, it offers a powerful toolkit with its CLI, it is currently available for Linux, MacOS and WSL users. To install it, run:</p>

<p><code>curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash</code></p>

<p>To see more of what Bun is and what it can do, check the <a href="https://bun.sh/docs">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why doing that?
</h2>

<p>We all know that NodeJS deals with it pretty well, but Bun is a really promising deal, so why not?? We programmers love to test and see what happens, especially to try out new things! </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Getting started
</h2>

<p>So now that we've got our bun CLI up and running, lets use nest CLI to generate two separate projects. They will be fully installed, built and run using both npm and bun so we can see the difference on first hand.</p>

<h5>
  
  
  Note: all the benchmarking will be tested with <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk/">wrk</a> using Arch Linux x86_64 environment.
</h5>

<h2>
  
  
  1. Dependency Install
</h2>

<p>After "nest newing" both projects, its time to see the first feature available on Bun, which is the package manager.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--llx4LJKq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t0bbb17e5xsz9npzdwdd.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--llx4LJKq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/t0bbb17e5xsz9npzdwdd.png" alt="npm install" width="616" height="246"></a><br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN9SxIh0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l5eecugkuq6nif83r7lb.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--BN9SxIh0--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/l5eecugkuq6nif83r7lb.png" alt="bun install" width="544" height="850"></a></p>

<p>We can already see some improvement here! Bun install is blasting fast and wins the first challenge.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. Development Server
</h2>

<p>We can't ignore the fact that a good development experience is a must have when it comes to frameworks. As both Bun and Node supports runtimes such as 'npm run start' we will have to see which one is the best when it comes to developing on real time. At the moment, NestJS is not using Bun.serve() to create a web server, so the comparisons we are making are all with the default NestJS provider.</p>

<p>Let's run both projects on different ports. Bun will be running on 3333 and Node will run on 4444 so we can easily see them acting.<br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SJaFJsDW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mgzahy7fm60frvvdi41.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--SJaFJsDW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1mgzahy7fm60frvvdi41.png" alt="Servers up" width="800" height="242"></a></p>

<p>Without any change, let's compare them with wrk. Note: we are not running them concurrently at the same time, which means that the following results were achieved with all the computational power dedicated to one and only one test at a time.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6-Uh1inp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp87mipomtk7xohpai81.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6-Uh1inp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lp87mipomtk7xohpai81.jpeg" alt="http tests on dev server" width="800" height="632"></a></p>

<p>We can see that Bun not only handles more requests per second (almost 2.4K requests more) but it has an average latency 30ms faster. This one is a solid win for Bun.</p>

<p>But this section ain't over, we still have something <strong>ALL</strong> developers love, and this is hot-reload. To enable hot-reload on NestJS using node, we need a service like nodemon to do that for us. Meanwhile on Bun we have the --watch arg that can be passed on bun start command. We have yet another type of hot-reload on Bun natively! But the watch key runs on file changes (which is the best for real time developers)</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p0M6uTPw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rp4t3rfk3ya5h2ce8f8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--p0M6uTPw--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/5rp4t3rfk3ya5h2ce8f8.png" alt="Bun hot reloader" width="800" height="342"></a></p>

<p>Our little Chinese bread Bun is now 2x0 against the big guy NodeJS.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  3. Testing
</h2>

<p>As we are too busy to write them from scratch, I guess we are going with the auto-generated test files from NestJS.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1jeeCZl1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3bi9615sjmotksz3s7r9.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1jeeCZl1--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3bi9615sjmotksz3s7r9.png" alt="Test runners" width="800" height="274"></a></p>

<p>WOOOOW, it seems NodeJS won't throw away the towel. Unlike the http requests battle, this one is by such a small difference that we don't feel comfortable using it. Our tiebreaker was expected to be the native test modules, but both NodeJS and Bun are loaded with a test runner, and as we are only considering Jest results, NodeJS can take this one and make it a 2x1 difference for Bun.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  4. Build and deployment
</h2>

<p>Let's now build our giant Hello World NestJS application and see how it performs on raw using both "node dist/main.js" and  "bun run dist/main.js" as well as the build time.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4gm5zyXx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07o047s1sl7oc5sohp3d.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4gm5zyXx--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/07o047s1sl7oc5sohp3d.png" alt="Build time" width="800" height="151"></a></p>

<p>And another tiny difference on our comparison, only 500ms difference for Bun! This tiny differences can be justified by the fact that we are testing such a small project. It is worth mentioning though that this is not over! We still need to compare performance running compiled projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1ZUVmkXB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68t94jbbqvczv1sihy0c.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1ZUVmkXB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/68t94jbbqvczv1sihy0c.png" alt="Builds running" width="800" height="161"></a></p>

<p>When in doubt, benchmark it out!</p>

<p>And again a solid one for Bun, it's worth noticing that when dealing with compiled NestJS, Bun handles almost 10 thousand requests more then when running it on a development server, holly cow!</p>

<p>Also, we can now compare the development server and build server on both Node and Bun. While Bun cut the average latency by half and more then double requests per second. Node also shows some better results by reducing latency and passing Bun on max requests per second by almost 1k.</p>

<p>In general, Node performance is pretty decent, meanwhile Bun is just stunningly powerful. This was a really great test but Bun takes it on 3x1.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>Overall, Bun can be really great on performance and deliver some amazing results. But we can't forget that it is currently on it's first version and can be very unstable on production, that's why I wouldn't recommend trading NodeJS by Bun on bigger projects. NodeJS is still the most reliable and trusted runtime environment to deal with JavaScript applications. However, Bun seems to be getting closer every step to take Node's crown. I was able to watch the early development of Bun since 0.3, times when running bun install would result on a segfault. Being able to see it grow it's own community and compete with giants like NodeJS is so nice.</p>
