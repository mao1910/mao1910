 #### - [Scoped C# - What you need to know (Guide)](https://dev.to/bytehide/scoped-c-what-you-need-to-know-guide-1a4g) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hey there, C# enthusiasts and pros alike! Buckle up as we dive deep into the ocean of C# to uncover the true essence of ‘Scoped C#’. This journey promises to be exciting, immersive, and informative. Just like Captain Nemo’s Nautilus, we are heading for a deep dive. Ready?</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Understanding the Concept of Scoped C#
</h2>

<p>Scoped C# is a versatile feature that allows programmers to manage the lifetimes of objects, encapsulating them within blocks of code or methods. The main essence of ‘Scoped C#’ lies in controlling the accessibility and duration of variables and objects. Let’s dig deeper into this concept, unveiling the myriad facets of it as we go along.</p>

<p>A scope in C# can be defined as a block of code where a variable or a function has its existence. It’s like a house where your variables and functions live. When we talk about scoped C#, it’s about how and where in the ‘house’ these variables and functions are defined and used.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="c1">//class-level scope: variable can be accessed by all methods within the class</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SampleClass</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">classLevelVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">MethodOne</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">methodOneVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">classLevelVariable</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// OK</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">MethodTwo</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">methodTwoVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">classLevelVariable</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Also OK</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Here, classLevelVariable is defined at the class level and hence, its scope extends to all methods within the SampleClass.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Importance of Scoped C#
</h3>

<p>Understanding C# scoping is imperative for any C# developer. Not only it helps us control the visibility and lifespan of your variables and objects, but it also aids in maintaining code neatness and reducing errors.</p>

<p>When we talk about scoping, variables are like your belongings and scopes are like rooms in a house. You wouldn’t want your personal belongings scattered all over the house, would you? The same concept applies in programming. Scoped C# ensures that each variable and object stays confined to its appropriate block (room), facilitating organized and error-free code.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">SampleMethod</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Local scope inside a method</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">localVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">true</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// Block scope inside the 'if' statement</span>
        <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">blockVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">localVariable</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// OK</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// Error: blockVariable doesn't exist here</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">anotherVariable</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">blockVariable</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this example, the blockVariable is defined within the ‘if’ block and is not accessible outside it. Trying to use blockVariable outside the ‘if’ block results in an error. This prevents misuse and creates clear, compartmentalized (or “scoped”) code.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SqlConnection</span> <span class="n">connection</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">SqlConnection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">connectionString</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">Open</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// Perform database operations</span>
    <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">command</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">SqlCommand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">queryString</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">command</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">ExecuteNonQuery</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span> 
<span class="c1">// Connection is automatically closed as we leave the defined scope</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Here, the scope is clearly defined for the SqlConnection object. The database connection is automatically closed once we step out of the using block. This way, Scoped C# not only makes your code manageable and efficient but also ensures optimal use of resources by automatically handling the disposal of objects saving you from potential memory leaks.</p>

<p>As you can see, learning the ropes of scoping in C# is more than just the icing on the cake — it’s more like the entire recipe!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Introduction to AddScoped C#
</h2>

<p>The term ‘AddScoped C#’ might seem like techno-jargon at first, but once you understand it, you’ll see it’s rather straightforward. It’s a method that comes from ASP.NET Core’s built-in service container. It is used for setting up services to be used via dependency injection.</p>

<p>When we say AddScoped, it means a new instance of the specified service is created and shared within each individual request to the application. That’s how it helps in managing resource utilization and isolation during the processing of HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Here’s a little secret: <em>AddScoped</em> is like the tailor of the programming world – just like a tailor stitches each outfit uniquely for each customer order, AddScoped creates a unique service instance for each unique request.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ConfigureServices</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IServiceCollection</span> <span class="n">services</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddScoped</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">IMyService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MyService</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>By invoking ‘AddScoped’ in the ‘ConfigureServices’ method, you’re telling .NET to add a scoped service of type ‘IMyService’ that, when requested, will return an instance of ‘MyService’.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Use Cases of AddScoped C#
</h3>

<p>It’s easy to get lost in the world of codes and methods. That’s why it’s important to understand where and how to use our newly acquired AddScoped knowledge. In C#, whenever we need to maintain a consistent behavior within a single transaction or a single HTTP request, that’s where AddScoped comes into play. Let’s say we are processing an HTTP Request in an MVC application and we have a service that retrieves user data from a database.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddScoped</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">IUserDataService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">UserDataService</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This code registers the UserDataService using an interface IUserDataService with a scoped lifetime. This means, within the scope of a single request, whenever IUserDataService is injected or used, it will provide the same instance of UserDataService. This ensures data consistency within a single transaction or request.</p>

<p>Let’s look at another scenario. Suppose you have a shopping cart functionality and you want each user or client to maintain their own cart-contents during their session or while their request is being processed.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddScoped</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">IShoppingCartService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ShoppingCartService</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Here, the ShoppingCartService instance created for each unique request (or user) will be different, ensuring a unique, private cart for each user.</p>

<p>In essence, AddScoped proves to be a game-changer in scenarios demanding consistency per request and user-specific behavioral patterns. It simplifies resource management and enables smoother application performance. It’s like having a personal assistant entrusted with the task of remembering and managing specific chores for you; it’s that efficient!</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Implementing C# File Scoped Namespace in Projects
</h3>

<p>Time to dive into the practical world and iron out the theory with some concrete examples of file scoped namespace.</p>

<p>The traditional namespace declaration looked something like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nn">Project</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In the above lines of code, we’ve created a namespace ‘Project’ and a class ‘MyClass’. You can see ‘MyClass’ is indented as it is inside the namespace ‘Project’ braces.</p>

<p>While nothing is wrong with this approach, C# 10 presents the file-scoped namespace, allowing for a sleeker declaration.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nn">Project</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyClass</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>As you can notice, the class declaration is at the same indent level as the namespace declaration itself. Not a single character more than necessary. You can immediately notice how it removes the extra indentations and reduces the clutter in the code, making it more readable.</p>

<p>This is the power of the “C# file scoped namespace”. It serves to be a crucial organizational tool that works wonders for larger files where there are multiple classes, as it significantly cuts down on unnecessary indentation.</p>

<p>Imagine having a large piece of code that spans multiple pages; decluttering and tidiness that file-scoped namespace offers can be a real lifesaver. The less clutter there is, the easier it is to read and maintain the code. So next time you’re working on a large project, consider using the file-scoped namespace feature to give your code a cleaner and neater look and enhance readability.</p>

<p>C# Scoped Services form a significant part of the ASP.NET core services. Generally, three types of service lifetimes exist in ASP.NET Core: Singleton, Transient, and Scoped. Scoped services hold a unique position as they are created once per client request (connection). This allows you to share resources within a request, making your programming more efficient.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Advantages of C# Scoped Services
</h3>

<p>There are several advantages to using Scoped services in C#. Here are a few of them with corresponding code examples.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Share Resources</strong> – Scoped services allow you to instantiate a service once and share it across your application. This can be advantageous when several parts of complex applications need to communicate with each other, as shown below:
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">ConfigureServices</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IServiceCollection</span> <span class="n">services</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// Registering our service with AddScoped </span>
    <span class="n">services</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">AddScoped</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="n">IMyService</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">MyService</span><span class="p">&gt;();</span>
    <span class="c1">// Now MyService can be shared and utilized within the application scope</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this code example, we’ve added to the collection of services. This service can now be shared and utilized within the application scope.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Less Memory Consumption</strong> – Since the service is created once for each user request, rather than each call within the request, there is less memory consumption as compared to Transient services. This aids in creating applications that are memory efficient.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyController</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Controller</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">readonly</span> <span class="n">IMyService</span> <span class="n">_myService</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Scoped service instance</span>

    <span class="c1">// The instance is injected through a constructor</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">MyController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IMyService</span> <span class="n">myService</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">_myService</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">myService</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="n">IActionResult</span> <span class="nf">Index</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">_myService</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">DoThings</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// Usage of the same instance initiated per request</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nf">View</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this code example, any usage of the object in an action method would refer to the same instance of throughout the entire request.</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Better Data Consistency</strong> – If a service is retrieving and working on data, Scoped services provide better data consistency since the same instance of the service is used through a single request.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyActionFilter</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">IActionFilter</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">readonly</span> <span class="n">IMyDataService</span> <span class="n">_myDataService</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nf">MyActionFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">IMyDataService</span> <span class="n">myDataService</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">_myDataService</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">myDataService</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">OnActionExecuting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ActionExecutingContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">var</span> <span class="n">data</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">_myDataService</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">RetrieveData</span><span class="p">();</span>
        <span class="c1">// The same instance of MyDataService is used for retrieving data</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">void</span> <span class="nf">OnActionExecuted</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ActionExecutedContext</span> <span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>In this case, the instance of is kept consistent throughout the request, ensuring that all data operations are synchronized.</p>

<p>However, just like the two sides of a coin, C# Scoped Services also have certain limitations. So be aware and conscious of how and where you are using them.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Disadvantages of C# Scoped Services
</h3>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Not Suitable for Multi-Threaded Environments</strong> – In a multi-threaded environment, Scoped services can lead to problems since they are not thread safe. Multiple threads can potentially modify service data simultaneously, creating a data inconsistency.</li>
<li>  <strong>Limited Lifetime</strong> – Scoped services have a lifetime only for the duration of a single request. The service must be created again for every new request, which can possibly introduce additional computation.</li>
<li>  <strong>Potential Memory Leaks</strong> – If Scoped services are not properly disposed of, they can create memory leaks. The developer must ensure that the services are correctly disposed of after the request finishes.</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s important to take away from this discussion is that choosing scopes for your services is critical. Their choice and utilization depends on the lifecycle required, whether they involve database communication, or whether concurrent access is possible, among others. In conclusion, a <a href="https://www.bytehide.com/blog/solid-principles-in-csharp">solid</a> understanding of Scoped services and their applicability in C# programming will certainly allow more efficient and coherent coding practices.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  A Closer Look at C# CreateScope Method
</h3>

<p>As a C# developer, frequently you might find yourself in a situation where you need to create your own scope for services. This is particularly the case when you’re handling background tasks or hosted services. The in C# is an apt method for such situations.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Boost Your Coding Practices with CreateScope C#
</h3>

<p>The ‘CreateScope’ method provided by the .NET core’s built-in IoC container enables you to create a new DI (Dependency Injection) scope within your application. Here’s a simple code snippet to illustrate this:<br>
</p>

 #### - [Using Bash and Python Together](https://dev.to/sm0ke/using-bash-and-python-together-2bli) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hello Coders! </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.docs.deploypro.dev/blog/using-bash-and-python">Using Bash and Python together</a></strong> to automate tasks on a Linux system is a powerful combination. <strong>Bash</strong> is the default shell in most Linux distributions, and <strong>Python</strong> is a versatile scripting language. <code>Thanks for reading!</code></p>




<p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to get started with using them together for automation:</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Install Python</strong>
</h2>

<p>Most Linux distributions come with Python preinstalled. You can check the installed Python version by running:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>python <span class="nt">--version</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>If Python is not installed or you want to use a specific version, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get update
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>python3
</code></pre>

</div>





<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Write Python Scripts</strong>
</h2>

<p>Create Python scripts to perform specific tasks or automation. Python is a versatile language for various automation needs, from file manipulation to web scraping. <br>
You can use Python's built-in libraries or install additional packages as needed.</p>

<p>Here's a <strong>simple example of a Python</strong> script that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Make Scripts Executable</strong>:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To run <strong>Python</strong> scripts as executable files from the command line, you need to make them executable. You can do this using the <code>chmod</code> command. For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">chmod</span> +x myscript.py
</code></pre>

</div>





<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Use Bash for Script Execution</strong>
</h2>

<p>You can use Bash to call and execute your Python scripts. For instance:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

python3 myscript.py
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Pass Command-Line Arguments</strong>
</h2>

<p>You can pass command-line arguments to your Python script from Bash. These arguments can be used to customize the behavior of your script. <br>
In Python, you can access these arguments using the <code>sys.argv</code> list from the <code>sys</code> module. For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight python"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sys</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">sys</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">argv</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>When calling this script from Bash, you can provide a name as an argument: <code>./myscript.py Alice</code> will print "Hello, Alice!"</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Automate Common Tasks</strong>
</h2>

<p>Identify tasks you want to automate on your Linux system. These tasks can range from file operations, backups, system maintenance, and more.</p>

<p>Write Python scripts that perform these tasks, and use Bash scripts to schedule them with tools like <code>cron</code> for regular execution.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Error Handling and Logging</strong>
</h2>

<p>Implement error handling and logging in your Python scripts to capture and handle exceptions gracefully. This ensures that you can troubleshoot issues and monitor the automation process effectively.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Security Considerations</strong>
</h2>

<p>Be mindful of security when automating tasks. Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text within your scripts. Instead, use secure methods like environment variables or encrypted files.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ✅ <strong>Testing and Debugging</strong>
</h2>

<p>Test your scripts thoroughly in a safe environment before deploying them for production use. Use debugging tools available in both Bash and Python to troubleshoot issues.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  ✅ More Advanced Samples
</h2>

<p>Here are a few more advanced examples of using Bash and Python together for automation on a Linux system:</p>

<h3>

<h3>
  
  
  Critical Files Monitoring
</h3>

<p>Monitoring critical files for changes and sending email notifications when edits occur can be a valuable security and auditing measure. Here's a Bash and Python script combination to achieve this:</p>

<p><strong>Bash Script (<code>file_monitor.sh</code>)</strong>:</p>

<p>This Bash script will periodically check the critical files for changes using their checksums (MD5 in this example). If a change is detected, it will trigger a Python script to send an email notification.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="c"># Define the critical files to monitor</span>

 #### - [What are Blockchain Layers and how do they work?](https://dev.to/hkaybaba/what-are-blockchain-layers-and-how-do-they-work-8e9) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>The functionality of Blockchain technology goes beyond its usage in/for peer-to-peer transactions. Every blockchain exists in stratified layers which are meant to facilitate its functionality at an optimal level. Basically, a blockchain is made up of five (5) layers and these layers play a distinct role in achieving this. Each layer is integral to assuring the security, transparency, and efficiency of transactions, and together, they make the blockchain a system that can handle all aspects of the development process, from storing and managing data to creating and deploying applications.</p>

<p>Join me on this exciting read as we find out more about these layers:</p>

<p><strong>1. Hardware/Infrastructure layer:</strong> The hardware/infrastructure layer refers to the physical framework that supports the blockchain network, which is basically made up of the nodes that contribute to the network's computing power. These nodes communicate with each other by exchanging information about the state of the network, responsible for verifying and recording transactions on the blockchain, as well as help to maintain the security and integrity of the network.</p>

<p><strong>2. Data layer:</strong> The data layer of a blockchain network is where the transaction details are stored. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of transactions, along with other information such as the hash of the previous block and the timestamp of the block. In addition to this, the public key of the recipient and the private key of the sender are also stored in each block. The public key is used to identify the recipient of the transaction, while the private key is used to sign the transaction.</p>

<p><strong>3. Network layer:</strong> The network layer of a blockchain network is a complex and critical part of a blockchain network that ensures that nodes can communicate with each other and that the data on the blockchain is secure. It links nodes, broadcasts transactions, and distributes data throughout the network, to ensure that all nodes in the network are aware of any transactions that take place, and this is essential for the security and transparency of the network.</p>

<p><strong>4. Consensus layer:</strong> The consensus layer of a blockchain network ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of each transaction. It does this by using a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) to maintain a set of logic that the nodes in the network follow to agree on the validity of transactions.</p>

<p><strong>5. Application layer:</strong> The application layer is the most topmost/visible layer of the blockchain architecture. It is where applications are built, deployed, and via which users interact with the blockchain for a variety of purposes. Smart contracts, Decentralized applications (dApps), and other software such as wallets and browsers are examples of tools that run on top of the application layer.</p>

 #### - [Zalgo Font Generator: Elevate Your Content with Creepy Text](https://dev.to/zalgotextgenerators/zalgo-font-generator-elevate-your-content-with-creepy-text-1b85) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>In the world of content creation, standing out is key to capturing your audience's attention. Whether you're a blogger, social media influencer, or website owner, finding unique ways to present your content can make a significant difference. </p>

<p>One intriguing method to elevate your content is by using the <strong><a href="https://zalgotextgenerators.com/">Zalgo font generator</a></strong>, which allows you to add a spooky and unsettling touch to your text. </p>

<p>In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of Zalgo fonts, exploring what they are, how they work, and how you can use them to create engaging and creepy content.</p>

<p><strong>What is a Zalgo Font?</strong></p>

<p>To understand Zalgo fonts, we first need to introduce you to Zalgo himself. Zalgo is a mythical and malevolent character often associated with chaos and corruption. </p>

<p>Zalgo is known for distorting and corrupting text, creating an eerie and unsettling visual experience. </p>

<p>The Zalgo font is designed to mimic this distortion, turning ordinary text into something that appears to be infected with the chaos of Zalgo himself.</p>

<p>Zalgo fonts consist of characters with additional diacritic marks, such as dots, lines, and slashes, placed above and below the standard characters. </p>

<p>These marks disrupt the text's regular flow, making it appear unstable and unsettling. When used correctly, Zalgo fonts can evoke a sense of dread and unease in your readers,</p>

<p>Making them perfect for horror-themed content, Halloween promotions, or any situation where you want to create a creepy atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>How Does a Zalgo Font Generator Work?</strong></p>

<p>Creating Zalgo text manually can be a painstaking task, as you need to meticulously add diacritic marks to each character. </p>

<p>Thankfully, Zalgo font generators are available online to simplify the process. These tools allow you to input your text, and they automatically generate the distorted Zalgo version for you.</p>

<p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how a Zalgo font generator typically works:</p>

<p><strong>Input Text:</strong> Begin by entering the text you want to transform into Zalgo font. It can be a sentence, a paragraph, or even an entire article.</p>

<p><strong>Customization:</strong> Some generators offer customization options, allowing you to control the level of distortion. You can choose between mild, moderate, or extreme distortion based on your preference.</p>

<p><strong>Generate:</strong> Once you've inputted your text and made any desired adjustments, click the "Generate" button. The tool will then process your text and provide you with the Zalgo-fied version.</p>

<p><strong>Copy and Paste:</strong> The generator will often display the distorted text, which you can easily copy and paste into your content, whether it's a blog post, social media caption, or website.</p>

<p><strong>Where to Find Zalgo Font Generators</strong></p>

<p>Finding a Zalgo font generator is a breeze, as many free online tools are readily available. A quick internet search for "Zalgo font generator" will yield a plethora of options. Some of the popular ones include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social Media Posts
**

<p><strong>Legibility:</strong> While the goal is to create an unsettling atmosphere, make sure your text remains somewhat legible. Extreme distortion may frustrate readers rather than engage them.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency:</strong> If you choose to use Zalgo fonts, do so consistently throughout your content. This helps maintain a coherent style and prevents the text from feeling randomly distorted.</p>

<p><strong>Emphasize Key Points:</strong> Use Zalgo fonts sparingly to highlight specific words or phrases, drawing attention to critical elements of your content.</p>

<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensure that your Zalgo text displays correctly on various devices and browsers. Test it across platforms to guarantee a smooth user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Audience Appropriateness:</strong> Consider your audience and the context in which you're using Zalgo fonts. They may not be suitable for all types of content or demographics.</p>
