 #### - [useState Hook in React](https://dev.to/parmita17/usestate-hook-in-react-296o) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>To handle multiple states using the useState hook in react, you can call the useState function multiple times, once for each state you want to manage. Here's an example:</p>

<p><code>import { useState } from 'react';</code><br>
<code>function MyComponent(props){</code><br>
<code>const [count,setCount]  = useState(0);</code><br>
<code>const [text, setText] = useState('');</code><br>
<code>function handleIncrement(){</code><br>
<code>setCount(count + 1);</code><br>
<code>}</code><br>
<code>function handleTextChange(event){</code><br>
<code>setText(event.target.value);</code><br>
<code>}</code><br>
<code>return (</code><br>
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;P&gt;Count : {count}&lt;p&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;button onClick = {handleIncrement}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;br /&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;input type="text" value= {text} onChange ={handleTextChange}/&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;p&gt; Text: {text}&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;/div&gt;</code><br>
<code>);}</code></p>

<p>In this example , we're managing two states using <code>useState:count</code> and <code>text</code>. We're also defining two functions : <code>handleIncrement</code>, which updates the <code>count</code> state when a button is clicked, and <code>handleTextChange</code> , which updates the <code>text</code> state when the text input changes.<br>
By calling <code>useState</code> twice , we're creating two independent pieces of state that can be managed separately. We're also using destructing to assign the current value of each state and its corresponding setter and its corresponding setter function to separate variables(<code>count</code> and <code>setCount</code>, and <code>text</code> and <code>setText</code>).<br>
Overall, using multiple useState hooks can help you manage multiple pieces of state in a clean and organized way.<br>
<strong>Other Alternative:</strong><br>
We can also manage multiple states using a single useState hook by passing an object as the initial state and using destructing to access individual state variables and their corresponding update functions.<br>
Here's an example:<br>
<code>import {useState} from 'react';</code><br>
<code>function MyComponent(props){</code><br>
<code>const[state, setState] = useState({count: 0, text: ''});</code><br>
<code>function handleIncrement(){</code><br>
<code>setState(</code><br>
<code>prevState =&gt; ({ ...prevState, count: prevState.count + 1})</code><br>
<code>);}</code><br>
<code>function handleTextChange(event){</code><br>
<code>setState(</code><br>
<code>prevState =&gt;({ ...prevState, text: event.target.value}</code><br>
<code>));</code><br>
<code>}</code><br>
<code>return (</code><br>
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;p&gt; Count: {state.count}&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;button onClick ={handleIncrement}&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;input type="text"</code><br>
<code>value={state.text} onChange ={handleTextChange} /&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;p&gt;Text: {state.text}&lt;/p&gt;</code><br>
<code>&lt;/div&gt;);}</code></p>

<p>In this example, we're still managing two pieces of state(<code>count</code> and <code>text</code>), but we're using a single <code>useState</code> hook to initialize both states as properties of an object(<code>state</code>). We're also using destructing to access individual state variables(<code>count</code> and <code>text</code>) and their corresponding update functions(<code>setState</code>).</p>

<p>To update a piece of state, we're using the functional update form of <code>setState</code>, which takes a callback function that receives the previous state as an argument and returns the new state. We're spreading the previous state using the spread operator(<code>...prevState</code>) to create a new object with all the previous state properties, and then updating the property we want to change(<code>count</code> or <code>text</code>) using object property shorthand.</p>

<p>Using a single <code>useSate</code> hook to manage multiple pieces of state can be a convenient way to keep related state together and reduce boilerplate code. However, it can also make code more complex and harder to read, especially if you have many pieces of state or complex state updates. So it's up to you to decide which approach works best for you for your specific use case.</p>

 #### - [Unity New Pricing in 2024 is Crazy](https://dev.to/godot/unity-new-pricing-in-2024-is-crazy-3hnn) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><em>Unity‚Äôs new pricing update sparks controversy among developers</em></p>

<p>Unity, one of the most popular game engines in the world, has announced a new pricing and packaging update that will affect games that exceed certain revenue and install thresholds, according to the official <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates">blog post</a>. The update aims to ‚Äúalign Unity‚Äôs success with the success of our customers‚Äù and to ‚Äúensure Unity remains a sustainable platform for all developers‚Äù.</p>

<p>The update introduces a runtime fee for games that generate more than $200,000 in revenue and have more than 200,000 installs in a month. The fee varies depending on the game‚Äôs price, ranging from $0.01 to $0.15 per install. Only games that meet the following thresholds qualify for the Unity Runtime Fee:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unity Personal and Unity Plus</strong>: Those that have made $200,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise</strong>: Those that have made $1,000,000 USD or more in the last 12 months AND have at least 1,000,000 lifetime game installs.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v509DtE9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sdc5vlfuoxik1qu9eyb2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--v509DtE9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sdc5vlfuoxik1qu9eyb2.png" alt="unity new pricing 2024" width="715" height="627"></a></p>

 #### - [How to Effectively Use Caching to Improve Microservices Performance](https://dev.to/amplication/how-to-effectively-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-performance-21c1) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h1>
  
  
  Introduction
</h1>

<p>In the dynamic landscape of modern software development, microservices have emerged as a powerful architectural paradigm, offering scalability, flexibility, and agility. However, maintaining optimal performance becomes a crucial challenge as microservices systems grow in complexity and scale. This is where caching becomes a key strategy to enhance microservices' efficiency.</p>

<p>This article will dive into the art of leveraging caching techniques to their fullest potential and ultimately boosting the performance of microservices.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  What are Microservices?
</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.writergate.com/editor/xshmqazeeq1s/6g3f0i7bu3i7">Microservices</a>¬†are a distinctive architectural strategy that partitions applications into compact, self-contained services, each tasked with a distinct business function.</p>

<p>These services are crafted to operate autonomously, enabling simpler development, deployment, and scalability.</p>

<p>This approach promotes agility, scalability, and effectiveness within software development.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  What is Caching?
</h1>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/caching/">Caching</a>¬†is a technique used in computer systems to store frequently accessed data or computation results in a temporary storage area called a "cache."</p>

<p>The primary purpose of caching is to speed up data retrieval and improve system performance by reducing the need to repeat time-consuming operations, such as database queries or complex computations.</p>

<p>Caching is widely used in various computing systems, including web browsers, databases, content delivery networks (CDNs), microservices, and many other applications.¬†</p>

<h1>
  
  
  <strong>What are the Different Types of Caching Strategies?</strong>
</h1>

<p>There are different types of caching strategies. We will explore database caching, edge caching, API caching, and local caching.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Database caching</strong>
</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/managing-databases/introduction-database-caching">Database caching</a>¬†involves storing frequently accessed or computationally expensive data from a database in a cache to improve the performance and efficiency of data retrieval operations. Caching reduces the need to repeatedly query the database for the same data, which can be slow and resource-intensive. Instead, cached data is readily available in memory, leading to faster response times and lower load on the database. There are a few different database caching strategies. Let's discuss them.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Cache aside:</strong>
</h3>

<p>In a¬†cache-aside¬†setup, the database cache is positioned adjacent to the database itself. When the application needs specific data, it initially examines the cache. The data is promptly delivered if the cache contains the required data (<strong>referred to as a cache hit)</strong>.¬†</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the cache lacks the necessary data (<strong>a cache miss</strong>), the application will proceed to query the database. The application then stores the retrieved data in the cache, making it accessible for future queries. This strategy proves particularly advantageous for applications that heavily prioritize reading tasks. The below image depicts the steps in the cache-aside approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XnqOYJm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/0.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XnqOYJm8--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/0.png" alt="" width="650" height="324"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Read through:</strong>
</h3>

<p>In a¬†read-through¬†cache configuration, the cache is positioned between the application and the database, forming a linear connection. This approach ensures that the application exclusively communicates with the cache when performing read operations. The data is promptly provided if the cache contains the requested data (cache hit). In instances of cache misses, the cache will retrieve the missing data from the database and then return it to the application. However, the application continues to interact directly with the database for data write operations. The below image depicts the steps in the read-through approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x5cEQBsC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--x5cEQBsC--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/1.png" alt="" width="800" height="399"></a></p>



<p>(image source: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/managing-databases/introduction-database-caching">prisma.io</a>)</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Write through:</strong>
</h3>

<p>Unlike the previous strategies we discussed, this strategy involves initially writing data to the cache instead of the database, and the cache promptly mirrors this write to the database. The setup can still be conceptualized similarly to the read-through strategy, forming a linear connection with the cache at the center. The below image depicts the steps in the write-through approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h-lZLGcr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/2.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--h-lZLGcr--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/2.png" alt="" width="650" height="324"></a></p>



<p>(image source: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/managing-databases/introduction-database-caching">prisma.io</a>)</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Write back:</strong>
</h3>

<p>The¬†write-back¬†approach functions nearly identical to the write-through strategy, with a single crucial distinction. In the write-back strategy, the application initiates the writing process directly to the cache as in the write-through case. However, in this case, the cache doesn't promptly mirror the write to the database; instead, it performs the database write after a certain delay. The below image depicts the steps in the write-back approach.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eMfose6H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eMfose6H--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/3.png" alt="" width="650" height="324"></a></p>



<p>(image source: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/managing-databases/introduction-database-caching">prisma.io</a>)</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Write around:</strong>
</h3>

<p>A write-around caching approach can be integrated with either a cache-aside or a read-through strategy. In this setup, data is consistently written to the database, and retrieved data is directed to the cache. When a cache miss occurs, the application proceeds to access the database for reading and subsequently updates the cache to enhance future access. The below image depicts the steps in the write-around approach.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Edge caching</strong>
</h2>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/media/iis-media-services/edge-caching-for-media-delivery">Edge caching</a>, also known as content delivery caching, involves the storage of content and data at geographically distributed edge server locations closer to end users. This technique is used to improve the delivery speed and efficiency of web applications, APIs, and other online content. Edge caching reduces latency by serving content from servers located near the user, minimizing the distance data needs to travel across the internet backbone. This is mostly useful for static content like media, HTML, CSS, etc.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>API Caching</strong>
</h2>

<p><a href="https://rapidapi.com/guides/api-caching">API caching</a> involves the temporary storage of API responses to improve the performance and efficiency of interactions between clients and APIs. Caching API responses can significantly reduce the need for repeated requests to the API server, thereby reducing latency and decreasing the load on both the client and the server. This technique is particularly useful for improving the responsiveness of applications that rely heavily on external data sources through APIs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Local caching</strong>
</h2>

<p>Local caching, also known as client-side caching or browser caching, refers to the practice of storing data, files, or resources on the client's side (such as a user's device or web browser) to enhance the performance of web applications and reduce the need for repeated requests to remote servers. By storing frequently used data locally, local caching minimizes the latency associated with retrieving data from remote servers and contributes to faster page loads and improved user experiences.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  <strong>What are the Benefits of using Caching in Microservices?</strong>
</h1>

<p>Utilizing caching in a microservices architecture can offer a multitude of benefits that contribute to improved performance, scalability, and efficiency. Here are some key advantages of incorporating caching into microservices:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Enhanced Performance &amp; Lower Latency:</strong> Caching reduces the need to repeatedly fetch data from slower data sources, such as databases or external APIs. Cached data can be quickly retrieved from the faster cache memory, leading to reduced latency and faster response times for microservices.</li>
<li>  <strong>Reduced Load on Data Sources:</strong> By serving frequently requested data from the cache, microservices can alleviate the load on backend data sources. This ensures that databases and other resources are not overwhelmed with redundant requests, freeing up resources for other critical tasks.</li>
<li>  <strong>Improved Scalability:</strong> Caching allows microservices to handle increased traffic and load more effectively. With cached data, microservices can serve a larger number of requests without overloading backend systems, leading to better overall scalability.</li>
<li>  <strong>Optimized Data Processing:</strong> Microservices can preprocess and store frequently used data in the cache, allowing for more complex computations or transformations to be performed on cached data. This can result in more efficient data processing pipelines.</li>
<li>  <strong>Offline Access and Resilience:</strong> In scenarios where microservices need to operate in offline or disconnected environments, caching can provide access to previously fetched data, ensuring continued functionality.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>Key Considerations When Implementing Caching in Microservices</strong>
</h1>

<p>Implementing caching in a microservices architecture requires careful consideration to ensure that the caching strategy aligns with the specific needs and characteristics of the architecture. Here are some key considerations to keep in mind when implementing caching in microservices:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Data Volatility and Freshness:</strong> Evaluate the volatility of your data. Caching might not be suitable for data that changes frequently, as it could lead to serving stale information. Determine whether data can be cached for a certain period or whether it requires real-time updates.</li>
<li>  <strong>Data Granularity:</strong> Identify the appropriate level of granularity for caching. Determine whether to cache individual items, aggregated data, or entire responses. Fine-tuning granularity can impact cache hit rates and efficiency.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Invalidation:</strong> Plan how to invalidate cached data when it becomes outdated. Consider strategies such as time-based expiration, manual invalidation, or event-based invalidation triggered by data changes. This is arguably the most challenging part of implementing caching successfully. I recommend giving this careful thought during system design, particularly if you're not very experienced with caching.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Eviction Policies:</strong> Choose appropriate eviction policies to handle cache capacity limitations. Common strategies include Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), and Time-To-Live (TTL) based eviction.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Consistency:</strong> Assess whether data consistency across microservices is critical. Depending on the use case, you might need to implement cache synchronization mechanisms to ensure data integrity.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cold Start:</strong> Consider how to handle cache "cold starts" when a cache is empty or invalidated, and a high volume of requests is received simultaneously. Implement fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle such situations. Consider implementing an artificial cache warm-up when starting the service from a "cold" state.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Placement:</strong> Decide where to place the cache ‚Äì whether it's inside the microservices themselves, at the API gateway, or in a separate caching layer. Each option has its benefits and trade-offs in terms of ease of management and efficiency.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Segmentation:</strong> Segment your cache based on data access patterns. Different microservices might have distinct data access requirements, and segmenting the cache can lead to better cache utilization and hit rates.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cache Key Design:</strong> Design cache keys thoughtfully to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts. Include relevant identifiers that accurately represent the data being cached. Choose keys that are native to the consuming microservices.</li>
<li>  <strong>Cloud-Based Caching Services:</strong> Evaluate the use of cloud-based caching services, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">Amazon ElastiCache</a> or <a href="https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/">Redis Cloud</a>, for managed caching solutions that offer scalability, resilience, and reduced maintenance overhead.</li>
</ul>

  <strong>Overview of Popular Caching Tools</strong>
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Redis</strong>
</h3>

<p>Redis is an open-source data structure store that functions as a database, cache, messaging system, and stream processor. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, <a href="https://redis.io/docs/data-types/probabilistic/hyperloglogs/">hyperloglogs</a>, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis offers built-in features such as replication, scripting in Lua, LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction, transactions, and multiple levels of data persistence. Additionally, it ensures high availability through Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning via Redis Cluster. The below image depicts how Redis is traditionally used.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nc9soX2B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/5.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Nc9soX2B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/5.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="442"></a></p>



<p>Redis prioritizes speed by utilizing an in-memory dataset. Depending on your needs, Redis can make your data persistent by periodically saving the dataset to disk or logging each command to disk. You also have the option to disable persistence if your requirement is solely a feature-rich, networked, in-memory cache. Redis can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of microservices architectures. It offers fast data retrieval, caching capabilities, and support for various data structures.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while Redis can significantly enhance microservices performance, it also introduces some considerations, such as¬†<a href="https://www.designgurus.io/blog/cache-invalidation-strategies">cache invalidation</a>¬†strategies, data persistence, and memory management. Proper design and careful consideration of your microservices' data access patterns and requirements are crucial for effectively leveraging Redis to improve performance.</p>

<p>üí°Pro Tip: <a href="https://amplication.com/">Amplication</a> now offers a <a href="https://github.com/amplication/plugins/tree/master/plugins/cache-redis">Redis Plugin</a> that can help you integrate Redis into your microservices more easily than ever before.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Memcached</strong>
</h2>

<p>Memcached is another popular in-memory caching system that can be used to improve the performance of microservices. Similar to Redis, Memcached is designed to store and retrieve data quickly from memory, making it well-suited for scenarios where fast data access is crucial. It is a fast and distributed system for caching memory objects. While it's versatile, its initial purpose was to enhance the speed of dynamic web applications by reducing the workload on databases. It's like a brief memory boost for your applications.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tC7dJy3l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/6.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tC7dJy3l--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://static-assets.amplication.com/blog/how-to-use-caching-to-improve-microservices-peformance/6.png" alt="" width="251" height="468"></a></p>



<p>Memcached can redistribute memory surplus from certain parts of your system to address shortages in other areas. This optimization aims to enhance memory utilization and efficiency.</p>

<p>Consider the two deployment scenarios depicted in the diagram:</p>

<ul>
<li>  In the first scenario (top), each node operates independently. However, this approach is inefficient, with the cache size being a fraction of the web farm's actual capacity. It's also labor-intensive to maintain cache consistency across nodes.</li>
<li>  With Memcached, all servers share a common memory pool (bottom). This ensures that a specific item is consistently stored and retrieved from the same location across the entire web cluster. As demand and data access requirements increase with your application's expansion, this strategy aligns scalability for both server count and data volume.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the illustration shows only two web servers for simplicity, this concept holds as the server count grows. For instance, while the first scenario provides a cache size of 64MB with fifty servers, the second scenario yields a substantial 3.2GB cache size. It's essential to note that you can opt not to use your web server's memory for caching. Many users of Memcached choose dedicated machines specifically designed as Memcached servers.</p>

 #### - [Bun: The Next Big Thing in Javascript](https://dev.to/kalashin1/bun-the-next-big-thing-in-javascript-jeg) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><a href="https://bun.sh/">Bun</a> is a Javascript runtime that claims to be 4x faster than <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>. Bun is an all-in-one Javascript runtime &amp; toolkit. Bun ships as a single executable that can be installed on your computer. Bun is written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, a low-level general-purpose programming language. Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language. Zig is supposed to be a replacement for C and C++. Zig is designed to be smaller and simpler to program in while also offering modern features,  so you'd expect applications built with Zig to be quite fast, a feature that spills into Bun.</p>

<p>Bun also ships as a package manager that can be installed with the <code>npm install bun</code> command, which Bun also claims will be the last npm command you ever run, I'll keep an eye on this because the bum package manager claims to be 33X faster than npm when installing packages and all existing npm packages can be installed with the bun package manager.</p>

<p>Bun is also a test runner and it is a direct replacement for existing test runners because it claims to be 32X faster than Jest+Babel and 8X than Vitest. These are crazy numbers. A stable 1.0 version of Bun was recently released in September 2023. </p>

<p>Bun is designed with three main goals in mind;</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Simplicity</li>
<li>Providing a full development ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<p>In today's post, I'm going to go over 6 reasons why I think Bun is the next big thing since Typescript. Here are the main talking points;</p>

<ul>
<li>Full compatibility with NodeJS </li>
<li>Out-of-the-box support for Typescript </li>
<li>Consistent module imports </li>
<li>Default Watch Mode </li>
<li>Bun Internal APIs </li>
<li>Compact Development Experience </li>
<li>Why should you care?</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Full compatibility with NodeJS
</h2>

<p>Bun is intended to be a direct replacement for NodeJS, it offers full support for all of the existing NodeJS APIs and you will feel just at home like you're working with NodeJS. This is important because most developers would rather just stick to what works especially if they have to start adapting to using newer APIs. The full compatibility with NodeJS will significantly reduce the learning or adoption curve.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Out-of-the-box support for Typescript
</h2>

<p>Bun has first-class support for Typescript and it will directly execute your Typescript modules without any further compilation step. This can significantly reduce your overall build step because you are not worried about converting your Typescript to valid Javascript, which has already been taken care of.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Consistent module imports
</h2>

<p>Bun allows you to do what I call a "consistent module import" This catchy phrase just means that Bun reduces all your worries about <code>moduleResolution</code>. You can use <code>import {} from 'file'</code> or <code>require('module')</code> in any of your modules and you can even mix them in the same file and everything will work just fine, eliminating the need to configure and use a consistent module Resolution throughout your codebase.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Default Watch Mode
</h2>

<p>Bun has a default watch mode in which you can run your apps. This will allow you to preview live changes in your applications as they happen without having to configure them or install a package for that. This is in stark contrast to NodeJS where you have to install the <code>nodemon</code> package if you want to develop your application in watch mode. This is another bonus to your overall workflow because you don't need to set up nodemon for any of your future projects on Bun.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Internal APIs
</h2>

<p>Buns also has its internal APIs that are different from the core NodeJS APIs. Although they offer the same functionalities as the NodeJS API they're more elegant and simpler to use when compared to Nodejs core APIs. There is the <code>Bun. serve({})</code> which allows you to quickly spin up a server. Compare this to how many lines of code it would take to spin up a server in NodeJS. There are also APIs for reading and writing to files that are more elegant than what we currently have in NodeJS.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Compact Development Experience
</h2>

<p>The overall goal of Bun is to provide developers with a complete toolbox for developing applications from a single platform. Most of the existing steps in application setup and development are already taken care of by Bun. Allowing you to focus on developing your application as fast as possible as opposed to trying to set up your development environment first. Gone are the days of <code>npm I demon, gone are also the days of</code>npm i -D @types/package`. This is another reason why Bun is so easy to use.</p>

<p>There are other awesome features of Bum that we had to skip in this post for time's sake nonetheless here is a quick breakdown;</p>

<ul>
<li>Bun implements most of the Existing Web APIs directly into the run time, things like fetch, alert, confirm, etc.</li>
<li>Bun supports <code>.jsx</code> and <code>.tsx</code> files out of the box. </li>
<li>Bun has the fastest package manager with an install speed of less than half a second.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Why should you care?
</h2>

<p>Does this mean that we should all uninstall our NodeJS and start installing Bun, this is a highly unlikely situation because people adopt things slowly, so it's going to take some time before we see a large-scale adoption of Bun if at all it happens. Besides there are also some drawbacks to getting started with Bun.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is only available for installation on Linux and Mac OS, there is no Windows-compatible version of Bun, The only way to get around this is to install the WSL version.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found this to be very annoying as I am currently using a Windows PC and I don't want to set up WSL on it. But anyway let me know what your thoughts are on Bun, do you think that It will replace NodeJS and npm? How fast do you think that could happen if at all it will happen? What would you like me to write about Next Still on the Bun? I will see you in the next post.</p>
