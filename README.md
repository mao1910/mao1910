 #### - [Writing My First Pull Request](https://dev.to/pbelokon/writing-my-first-pull-request-2j50) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>This week in my OSD600 course, I was tasked with contributing to another student's project by implementing a Markdown parsing feature to their static site generator.</p>

<p>One of the cool things I discovered was the ability to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword">link an issue</a> to the pull request simply by using its number. This was a GitHub feature I never knew about.</p>

<p>I have picked <a href="https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/ez-txt2html">ez-txt2html</a> by <a href="https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt">Bryce Seefieldt</a> since I have never tried writing Python 3 code. My only significant experience with Python was during my high school years when I was developing a Pygame-based evasion game (sadly, I don't have the files to link and show it).</p>

<p>Let's talk about the <a href="https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/ez-txt2html/pull/5">pull request</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/bryce-seefieldt/ez-txt2html/issues/4">issue</a> I was working on this week. </p>

<p>The process was straightforward. I created an issue on the project, and then the owner assigned it to me. Once I had completed my changes, I posted my pull request and linked it to the issue.</p>

<p>What I did was use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">re</a> library of Python, which allowed me to employ regular expressions. Whenever the program read the .md file, it would parse it with the help of these regular expressions. Since we were constrained from using any markdown parsing libraries, I found this approach to be both easy to understand and modify, as parsing solely depended on the way the regular expressions were written.</p>

<p>The owner of the repo merged it quite quickly since I tried to match the style and structure of the code as closely as possible to the original and touched the main logic as little as possible.</p>

<p>The only problem I encountered was installing the project and getting it to work locally because we had not created proper contribution instructions or a wiki for our projects yet. I had a conflict between the Python version on my computer and the one that the project required.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about contributing to open source, and when my pull request got merged, I felt incredibly proud and happy to see my code in the main branch. This experience fired me up to look for repositories to contribute to during <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. Slowly, I started to understand how to participate in open source, although I haven't tried contributing to any big projects yet.</p>

 #### - [Offer Digital Assets Using Mintbase JS](https://dev.to/starpause/offer-digital-assets-using-mintbase-js-c85) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XFBk39CB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7g359k9jx8owln5qzeki.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XFBk39CB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/7g359k9jx8owln5qzeki.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="800"></a></p>

<p>The Mintbase API empowers web developers to integrate digital collectibles into their toolkit. This is your gateway to the web3 industry that witnessed a staggering 552% growth in developer demand in 2022! </p>

<p>By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully configured environment ready for diving deeper into web3 with a powerful JavaScript API. Even if you're just starting out with JavaScript, you'll find this guide easy to follow. Plus, if you complete the tutorial by October 11th, 2023, you'll have a chance to <a href="https://starpause.com/mintbase">win a share of the $1,000 prize pool</a>!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Near Protocol
</h2>

<p>Mintbase makes it easy to interact with the NEAR blockchain using Javascript. Why NEAR? Because It's carbon-neutral and has bullet proof scalability that's trusted by giants like <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon/status/1702155228932718756">KAI-CHING (the #1 dApp in the world)</a>. NEAR also has web2 ready UX and flexible account models that make it a perfect partner for enterprise and commerce companies. </p>

<p>Grabbing a NEAR account via <a href="https://shard.dog/near_intern">shard.dog link</a> is a perfect demonstration of the seamless onboarding process. Especially worth checking if you're participating in <a href="https://starpause.com/mintbase">the contest</a> as you'll need a NEAR name to claim prizes.¬†</p>

<p>You'll also need to <a href="https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/">create a testnet account</a> to follow along with the tutorial. Each testnet account comes with a bunch of tokens for experimenting and development. If you run out of testnet tokens you can always make another account!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Mintbase on Testnet
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8D2TfL1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmac6y75xa3npsuofbuh.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--8D2TfL1q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xmac6y75xa3npsuofbuh.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="390"></a></p>

<p>Now that you have a Testnet account you can easily create your own Mintbase contract. On the top right of the site be sure you're logged in and that you've selected NEAR TESTNET.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FeFiN8h6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y8i3tro5g2y6jrc4jcra.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--FeFiN8h6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/y8i3tro5g2y6jrc4jcra.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="629"></a></p>

<p>After confirming you're on Testnet head to <code>Manage -&gt; My Contracts</code> and then use the <code>New Contract</code> button. You can fill in the Store Name/Symbol with anything and proceed to paying the contract storage fee. </p>

<p>What's a storage fee? Instead of monthly payments to a hosting provider you make a one time payment to the Near network to keep your contract forever. 100kb costs ~1 NEAR token, which we're not too worried about with our play tokens on testnet. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TJC3_cwa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rvnenlbifqqvnu0o6b9i.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TJC3_cwa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rvnenlbifqqvnu0o6b9i.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="352"></a></p>

<p>Next head over to <code>Build -&gt; Developer API</code> to get your your Mintbase Testnet Developer Key. Use the <code>Generate New Key</code> button and Copy it for safe keeping. Normally you wouldn't share that key with anyone, but if you're participating in the contest you can <a href="https://starpause.com/mintbase">paste it on gleam for an entry</a>.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Forking a Marketplace
</h2>

<p>Now that your store contract exists on the blockchain it's possible to use any interface to interact with it, thanks to the power of decentralization. However, most business clients will want a dedicated store with customized branding. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K2niuCJT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u6t901suulv8x2e5pez.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--K2niuCJT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2u6t901suulv8x2e5pez.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="472"></a></p>

<p>An <a href="https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/simple-marketplace">example marketplace repository</a> demonstrates how you can use Mintbase JS to integrate web3 collectables into any front end you're familiar with. To clone and deploy the repository with Vercel go under <code>Build -&gt; Deploy a Marketplace</code>.</p>

<p>The last step is configuring the cloned marketplace to connect with the contract you created earlier. Follow the <a href="https://github.com/Mintbase/examples/tree/main/simple-marketplace">Simple Marketplace README.md</a> to rename the <code>.env.example</code> file and update the variables.</p>

<p>Submit your marketplace URL and the updated <code>.env</code> variables to the <a href="https://starpause.com/mintbase">gleam contest</a> for another two entries!</p>

 #### - [Has AI Taken My Job Yet?](https://dev.to/kallmanation/has-ai-taken-my-job-yet-9o4) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>AI will not change the world (the way you think it will). Exactly as the Internet did not change the world (the way early adopters thought it would).</p>

<p>Of course, our daily lives have drastically shifted in the 30 years since home internet connected us. And of course, our lives 30 years from now will look even more different after consumer AI weasels its way into everything we touch.</p>

<p>But if you don't remember the late 1900s, the internet advent came with a different optimism. The quintessential phrase of the day, "The Information Super Highway!!", encapsulates all the hopes and expectations of the technology. We still echo those hopes when we wax on about the sheer knowledge available a tap away. With all those learnings we'll all make better decisions, self-educate throughout our lives, and society will grow greener each day. Now I hear the emptiness in our echoes. This is not The Internet I was promised. And AI will not become what the sirens sing of today.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  It all started at Babel
</h1>

<p>You may already know, or you may be <a href="https://xkcd.com/1053/">today's lucky 10,000</a>, about the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/">Library of Babel</a>. Each time it makes a new round on social media there are a dozen reposts about how mind-blowing it is that everything ever written or that ever will be written already exists in the library.</p>

<p>Nearly every introduction to the Library of Babel leaves off at this unspoken existentialism. Implying that it could somehow change our lives if only we looked in the library for all the knowledge we are missing. They have not spent enough time in the library if they believe this, and it shows.</p>

<p>The creator of the library said <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/theory4.html">this</a> after building a search function able to take us directly to the book and page for a given passage of text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this leaves the frustration of using the library unaltered. One can find only text one has already written, and any attempt to find it in among other meaningful prose is certain to fail. The tantalizing promise of the universal library is the potential to discover what hasnt been written, or what once was written and now is lost. But there is still no way for us to find what we dont know how to look for. Unless, of course, <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?thefrustrationofthelibrary">youre brave enough to browse</a>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason the Library of Babel has not changed your life is because any useful knowledge is buried in a hopeless mire of gibberish.</p>

<p>Take this thought experiment: we are literally trapped in the Library of Babel, our world only consisting of bookshelf beside bookshelf with no escape, having never seen the sky outside. One day we miraculously find a page with the words "<a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?theskyisorange">The sky outside is orange</a>". Astounding scientific discovery?! No, the statement "<a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?theskyisblue100">The sky outside is blue</a>" must also exist within a different book, elsewhere in the library. The library contains all statements, both true and false. This is the nature of Universal Libraries. With no way to verify this statement, we can do nothing with the knowledge the library tried to bestow on us.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Universal Libraries
</h1>

<p>Such is the fate of all Universal Libraries. By containing information both useful and useless, only the librarians already knowing which books are useful can find a good book. By containing statements both true and false only the researchers already knowing what's true can find veracity. By containing stories both beautiful and ugly, only already discerning eyes can find the aesthetic.</p>

<p>Authorship bestows value to the works. Books, images, and songs are not worthwhile because they exist, but are valuable because they were authored. Out of all the sounds, of all the colors, of all the letters, this particular group was chosen and placed together; or more importantly, all the other combinations were removed, bringing focus to the worthwhile.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  The Internet
</h1>

<p>It strikes me that the Internet is a Universal Library. Perhaps the most universal we've built to date. (of course, containing the entire Library of Babel makes it more universal than that library on its own). Like Bo Burnham sang in <em>Welcome to the Internet</em> from his 2021 special, <em>Bo Burnham: Inside</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait. No, that isn't the quote I was looking for. This library is too big. Here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could I interest you in everything, all of the time? A little bit of everything, all of the time? [...] Anything and everything, all of the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly feels as though everything is here. This article is here. The Library of Babel is here. Infinite scrolling on every page.</p>

<p>Let me propose a test for you though; for each thing you see, ask yourself three questions, and be honest with how much of the content you consume satisfies all three:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is this mostly new to me?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this useful to me?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this true? Or is it misleading?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Be honest. Does 80% of the Internet satisfy just three questions? Even 20%? I was promised an "Information Super Highway" and instead I wade through an information swamp. The reins to unimaginable knowledge now bind me to a worthless merry-go-round of diversion.</p>

<p>Google boasts millions of results for every search, and yet I find the same shallow parroted lines behind every link. Worse than the Library of Babel, which mindlessly serves me gibberish, the Algorithms of the Internet have been crafted to serve me intentionally manipulative information: attempts to sway my votes and attempts to spend my dollars, mostly attempts at my dollars; never useful for <em>me</em> unless it's more useful to <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>And when you last searched, was there a <em>primary</em> source listed on the first page? I do not mean Wikipedia. I do not mean an article about news coverage of a new study. I mean the <em>actual source of information</em>. I find ten of the same rehashed summaries, probably written by a computer, and if I'm lucky one of them has linked to their source (which is paywalled and out of date).</p>

<p>We fell for the siren song of a Universal Library. Now I hear a remix crescendoing.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  Generative AI
</h1>

<p>So far, Artificial Intelligence (AI) manufactures uncanny mimicries of human intelligence. AI, like humans, <em>mostly</em> recombines information into non-novel restatements of the same. <em>Occasionally</em> an AI, like a human, forms a novel combination: emergent work from previous learnings. Of those emergent works, some portion are truthful (that is, the predictions drawn from them will match reality) and some portion are false.</p>

<p>Unlike a human, an AI has no means to assess its novel works. Like the librarians of Babel, the AI is trapped within its Universal Library: the Internet. It cannot know if the sky is blue or orange outside of words and images transmitted to it via the Internet.</p>

<p>When training human minds, our teachers take great care to bring new, useful, truthful information into the developing intelligence. Have we taken the same care when training artificial minds? Or do we blindly feast them on a Universal Library?</p>

<p>When done blindly, the AI becomes a larger Universal Library than the content it consumed. As it becomes more universal, <a href="https://futurism.com/ai-trained-ai-generated-data-interview">it paradoxically becomes less useful</a>. Interactions devolve into hallucinations and false citations; how could the AI know any better? That is all it experienced on the Internet. Employing the AI only gives legs to the Universal Library of the Internet. It is no more true than before. It is no more useful than before. The difference is that now it enacts its disheveled will without the filter of external curation.</p>

<h1>
  
  
  What will change?
</h1>

<p>We finally come to the biggest headline (that I see) from Generative AI advancements: "Programmers around the world, out of a job". Except, that headline <a href="https://dev.to/kallmanation/nolow-code-why-hasnt-it-won-56an-temp-slug-5179755">has been running for 30 years</a>. And it does not sound any different than the existential dread in the shallow sharing of those discovering the <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/">Library of Babel</a>. They both have it wrong.</p>

<p>As I said, programmers have been "replaced by technology" since before I was born. How did I make a career doing something that shouldn't exist? How do I know I'll still exist despite AI "taking my job"?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. Each time a new technology enters meant to replace the skills of a professional, a new set of skilled professionals arises to interact with that technology. We saw it again this time around, before the ink on the "out of a job" headline dried, a new job title arose: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering">Prompt Enginee</a>r.</p>

<p>The skills we can see change; less documentation on syntax, perhaps a touch more psychology. But the jobs continue. And <em>why</em> these classes of "technical" people always arise is because the skills we <em>can't see</em> stay the same. A craving for learning things, tenacity when facing challenging puzzles, creatively bringing different solutions to the same situation.</p>

<p>So, until AI does <em>everyone's</em> jobs, there will be jobs titled <em>something</em> engineer to take care of the rest. I'll see you all there.</p>

 @jaitramadandij knows how much it sucks to struggle in learning something new, but some pain is required to get those gains. How do you get past these obstacles in learning?

 Superpowers allow you to do something unique or something beyond what people without those powers could do. @szabgab asks, what superpower would programmers have if they were given them?
