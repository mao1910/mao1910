 #### - [How to test and analyze website performance with lighthouse](https://dev.to/luwadev/how-to-test-and-analyze-website-performance-with-lighthouse-6oe) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Lighthouse is an open-source automated tool developed by Google, used for testing and improving the quality of web pages in terms of performance, accessibility, search engine optimization(SEO), and more.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll cover how you can use lighthouse to test and analyze any website for performance.</p>

<p>Before we start, let's understand the types of workflows lighthouse offers.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Lighthouse Workflows
</h2>

<p>lighthouse offers four workflows you can use to run series of test/audits on a web page:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Chrome DevTools: You can directly test any web page from your Chrome browser and read your reports in a user-friendly format.</li>
<li>From the command line: This let's you automate lighthouse runs using shell scripts</li>
<li>As a Node module: Integrate Lighthouse into your continuous integration systems.</li>
<li>From a web UI: You can also run Lighthouse directly from a web UI and also link to reports without installing a thing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll be using Chrome DevTools to learn how to test a web page for performance with lighthouse. You can check out any of the workflows above <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools">here</a>: </p>

<p>With that out of the way, let's run lighthouse.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
</h2>

<p>Use the following steps to run lighthouse test in your devtools:<br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Download chrome for Desktop<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the URL of the website you want to test<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Open chrome Devtools and click the <code>Lighthouse</code> tab </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tflssxS4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nbjtgdstuf9bprnz46z1.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tflssxS4--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nbjtgdstuf9bprnz46z1.png" alt="chrome devtools" width="800" height="388"></a></p>

<p>Lighthouse offers three modes you can use to run tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Navigation mode: The navigation mode is useful if you want to analyze a single page load.</li>
<li>Timespan mode: Timespan is used to analyze user interactions on a web page</li>
<li>Snapshot mode: It typically analyzes the page in a particular state</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/HEAD/docs/user-flows.md">learn more about each mode</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select Navigation mode, and since we are testing only for performance, uncheck the other categories except for <code>performance</code>.<br>
<strong>Step 5:</strong> Click <code>Analyze page load</code> to run lighthouse.</p>

<p>After 30 to 60 seconds, Lighthouse gives you a report on the page.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IY1cadpq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwlzp0ru8phhl8w27bvq.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--IY1cadpq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xwlzp0ru8phhl8w27bvq.png" alt="running lighthouse audits" width="800" height="456"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Performance Analysis
</h2>

<p>Lighthouse reports your website performance based on five speed metrics, each measuring some aspect of page speed (also called "load speed") </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VE2s3BkE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kudzn516tsh66cmcxkid.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VE2s3BkE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kudzn516tsh66cmcxkid.png" alt="lighthouse metrics" width="769" height="308"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>First Contentful Paint (FCP): Measures the time at which the first image or text becomes visible to users.</li>
<li>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): It calculates the amount of time a page takes to load it's largest element to users.</li>
<li>Total Blocking Time (TBT): Measures the amount of time a page is blocked from reacting to user input, for example, a mouse click</li>
<li>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures the number of layout shifts that occurs as user assess the page.</li>
<li>Speed Index (SI): Shows how quickly the content of a page is loaded.</li>
</ul>

<p>After Lighthouse is done testing your website, it assigns an overall performance score to a page based on how it performed for all these metrics. The score can be anything from 0 to 100.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5m7EQTZq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zkno64954w060llpoeml.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--5m7EQTZq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zkno64954w060llpoeml.png" alt="overall performance" width="448" height="268"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>A score between 90 and 100 indicates the page is well optimized for user experience.</li>
<li>Anything less that 90 means there are some/significant number of resources on your page that are slowing things down, therefore affecting the overall page experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lighthouse also gives you suggestions. Which you can implement the performance of your web page.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1661tE6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tcg324y4et7s50j10583.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1661tE6w--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tcg324y4et7s50j10583.png" alt="Idiagnostics" width="771" height="503"></a></p>

<p>To make you feel a little bit better :-) <br>
Lighthouse also gives you a report of tests your website passed.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3hTYBWjq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/utvqsiuekmikwnc2h1bu.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--3hTYBWjq--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/utvqsiuekmikwnc2h1bu.png" alt="passed audits" width="746" height="517"></a></p>

<p>"Was it all a dream?" he whispered, rubbing stiff shoulders. But no - this wasn't his apartment. The unfamiliar symbols on the walls told of another place, another reality.</p>

<p>His eyes were drawn to a table in the corner, equipped with throwing stars, knives, and a short sword. "Okay, that's either really cool or really concerning," he said out loud, contemplating the hint of adventure and danger that seemed to linger in the air.</p>

<p>Just then, he noticed a unique three-tailed, orange-and-black-striped cat lounging near his bed. The cat looked up, its eyes almost sage-like. "Wow, the house pet here is really something," Jason said, chuckling.</p>

<p>Jason's eyes darted back to the table of weapons, reminding him of the "Eye of Debugger," an ability he'd unlocked the other day. This skill had offered him a surreal, code-like overlay of the real world. Despite the awe it inspired, reactivating it proved elusive.</p>

<p>Eager to try it again, Jason closed his eyes and focused. He tried to recapture the state of mind he was in when he first activated the "Eye of Debugger." Deep breaths, focus, and then... "Eye of Debugger," he thought. Nothing happened. He opened one eye and then the other. The room remained steadfastly normal, and the three-tailed cat looked almost amused.</p>

<p>Feeling a sense of frustration, Jason had a moment of clarity. Could the "Eye of Debugger" operate like a mental command line? He relaxed his posture, cleared his mind, and spoke the words out loud: "Show me the digital world." Almost instantaneously, he heard the familiar voice in his head say, "Eye of Debugger, activated."</p>

<p>Both of his eyes began to perceive the environment in a completely new light. Objects in the room were surrounded by glowing grids and cryptic symbols. As his eyes locked onto a knife on the table, an interactive menu flickered into existence, inviting him to check deeper.</p>

<p>Thrilled by his newfound control, Jason realized the importance of the ability to switch between the two visions was vital. Guided by his common sense, he focused his thoughts on the counter-command: "Show me the magical world." As if on cue, the cryptic symbols and digital grids began to fade, allowing his eyes to adjust back to the room's natural hues and enchanting atmosphere.</p>

<p>Curiosity bubbling, Jason's eyes flicked back to the orange and black striped cat lounging on a corner cushion. Intrigued, he couldn't help but think how much more interesting the feline would be with nine tails instead of just three. He imagined the digital interface springing to life around the cat. He was hoping for options like 'add tail' or something cooler.</p>

<p>"If only I could give you six more tails and make you a real mythic creature," he thought, amused by the idea.</p>

<p>However, as he focused on the cat through his "Eye of Debugger," he realized that the digital outline didn't offer any options for interaction. It was like a locked interface‚Äîimpossible to edit or alter.</p>

<p>His eyes wandered back to the inanimate objects. When he focused on them, menus would materialize in his vision, ready for his mental commands to manipulate them. But the cat? Nothing.</p>

<p>"Guess living things aren't open-source," he thought, disappointed at his own limitations.</p>

<p>As he heard louder voices outside the hut, he opened the wooden door and walked outside. What he saw was an old-fashioned village, about the size to house maybe 50 people. Roofs made of straw and cobblestone pathways gave it an old-world charm. People were going about their day, trading, talking, and some children even playing in the distance. The air was filled with a mix of interesting smells: fresh earth, flowers, and something delicious cooking not too far away.</p>

<p>While Jason was soaking in the scenery, an elderly man walked up to him. This man had a kindly face and eyes that seemed to twinkle, despite the wrinkles around them. "How are you feeling, young man?" he asked. He introduced himself as Dalos, the village chief.</p>

<p>The strangest part was that Jason understood him. He didn't recognize the words, but he understood their meaning instantly. It was like his mind was translating the language in real-time.</p>

<p>Confused but wanting to communicate, Jason used a mix of sign language and words, saying, "I can't speak your language. My name is Jason, thank you for saving my life." The words that came out of his mouth were not in any language he knew, but everyone around seemed to understand him perfectly. His eyes widened, suddenly realizing that something was translating for him automatically. "Is this another feature of this weird place?" he wondered, slightly unnerved but also fascinated.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Jason's words, the villagers burst into laughter. It was a warm, hearty sound that filled the air. They all seemed to think that Jason, whom they believed to be a legendary hero, was making a joke. Jason looked around, puzzled but relieved that they were at least in good spirits about his presence.</p>

<p>Just then, a man with a stern expression stepped forward. "Ah, the 'legendary hero,'" he said slowly, with clear contempt in every word. "It's truly awe-inspiring how you bravely turned tail at the first sight of a mere bull." This man was Gurlan, and he was clearly unimpressed with the village's newfound savior.</p>

<p>Jason remembered the incident Gurlan mentioned. He had indeed run away from a bull, adrenaline fueling his legs, terror gripping his heart. But he had no idea why these people were calling him a 'legendary hero.' What did they mean by that? And more importantly, why did they need a hero? Doubts and questions swirled in his mind, making him realize he had much more to learn about this strange new world.</p>

<p>Dalos, the village chief, cleared his throat loudly, signaling for the chatter to cease. "Enough, Gurlan," he said with authority but not without a twinkle in his eyes. "You'll have ample time to exchange jokes with our guest later. Let me formally welcome you." He turned to Jason. "I am Dalos, the village chief. Welcome to Capsteen, our humble village. May I introduce my grandsons? This is Gurlan," he gestured toward the stern young man, "and this is his younger brother, Gular."</p>

<p>Gurlan grunted, keeping his stern look. In stark contrast, Gular waved with a big smile, clearly much friendlier than his brother.</p>

<p>Yet the interaction with Gurlan left him puzzled. "Why does he dislike me so much? We've never met." Jason thought. He couldn't help but wonder what he'd walked into and why Gurlan had taken such an immediate dislike to him. Was it something he'd done, or was Gurlan naturally this skeptical of strangers? Either way, Jason knew he had to tread carefully, at least until he had a better understanding of the village and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Gular, who was noticeably more cheerful than his older brother, stepped forward with a wide grin on his face. "Hey, you changed the color of that monolith, didn't you? Could you do the same for my toy horse?" He held out a small wooden horse, its paint chipped and faded.</p>

<p>Jason took a look at the wooden horse and then back at Gular. Nodding, he activated his 'Eye of Debugger.'' then focused on the wooden horse to select the decompile option. "Ah, the color property," he thought to himself. Inspired to do more this time, he mentally navigated to the color setting and chose a variety of shades: a red mane, a blue body, and yellow hooves. The wooden horse was transformed in an instant, now radiant in its new, multicolored form.</p>

<p>A ripple of astonishment swept through the village, accompanied by gasps and whispers from the villagers.</p>

<p>"Why does everyone look so surprised? Is this the first time you've seen a colored horse, or is my choice of color not to this village's liking?" Jason asked, puzzled by their reaction.</p>

<p>A villager stepped forward, awe still etched on his face. "It's not the color that surprises us; it's how you did it. You didn't utter a single word while casting your magic."</p>

<p>Dalos, the village chief, nodded his head in agreement with his fellow villager. "Indeed, spoken words channel the essence of our magic. It would be groundbreaking if someone could perform voiceless magic, let alone do something as permanent as you did." He gestured towards the red monolith that Jason had altered the day before, "That stone, for instance, has never been permanently altered. Your actions open up new possibilities we hadn't considered."</p>

<p>Gurlan mocked, layering his voice with heavy sarcasm. "So you can change the color of a toy horse without uttering a word, yet you don't know the first thing about how our magic works? That's... impressive in its own way, I guess. You're talented and dumb at the same time. What's next, saving the world with your unmatched ability to redecorate?"</p>

<p>Gurlan whirled around to face the villagers, his voice tinged with urgency. "Think about it! This is the 'legendary hero' we're pinning our hopes on? A man who flees from a mere bull and is clueless about our world!"</p>

<p>His eyes narrowed, and he pressed on. "Sure, he's got some peculiar talents. But do we really want to risk our community's fate on a total stranger? Someone who's so foreign to us, he might just turn those powers against us?"</p>

<p>A ripple of unease swept through the crowd. Their faces clouded with uncertainty as if Gurlan's words had unsettled a previously unspoken fear. The mood shifted; villagers exchanged wary glances, now reevaluating the wisdom of trusting Jason.</p>

<p>Feeling the crowd's skepticism weigh on him, Jason's mind raced. This village was his safest bet for learning more about this strange world. He couldn't afford to be cast out now. Losing their trust was not an option. "Look, I come in peace," he started cautiously, grasping for the right words. A flicker of inspiration hit him, offering a chance to hide his ignorance while still sounding like a legendary hero. He said "The last thing I remember is being in battle with a fearsome, three-headed dragon. After that, everything's a blur. I can't remember much, so bear with me as I try to figure things out."</p>

<p>The atmosphere shifted dramatically, from skepticism to awe. "Only a legendary hero would face a three-headed dragon," Gular mused, his eyes widening. "That's incredible! Who won? What spells did you use?" The crowd buzzed with excitement, their previous doubts momentarily forgotten as they regarded Jason as the heroic figure he portrayed himself to be.</p>

<p>Jason couldn't help but smirk. "Ha! Nailed it. Man, if only job interviews were this easy to bluff through."</p>

<p>Gurlan folded his arms, clearly unmoved by the crowd's shifting sentiments. "Someone ignorant who can perform voiceless magic had fought a three-headed dragon but is afraid of a mere bull? This doesn't add up. He could be a fraud, or even worse, a spy."</p>

<p>With a steely gaze, Gurlan turned to Jason. "How about a challenge? Prove your courage and skills. If you're as 'heroic' as you claim, then you should have no problem defending yourself."</p>

<p>Dalos stepped in to mediate, "Alright, a challenge it is then. But let's set some ground rules: the match ends when one of you either surrenders or becomes unconscious. No lethal force. And if you lose, young man," Dalos directed his gaze at Jason, "you leave this village."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," said Gurlan, smirking at Jason. "If you've battled a three-headed dragon, I should be a breeze, right? Unless, of course, you've been deceiving us."</p>

<p>Jason felt a surge of nervousness shoot through him, as though his stomach had dropped to his feet. The realization that he was about to duel, coupled with the looming threat of exile, set his heart pounding uncontrollably. "Hold on a second, when did I ever agree to a duel? What kind of mess have I walked into?" he thought. Swallowing hard, he struggled to put on a brave face while every fiber of his being screamed with anxiety and apprehension.</p>

<p>The villagers gathered around Gurlan, patting him on the back and nodding in agreement. "You always have the village's best interests at heart, Gurlan. That's why you'll make a great chief one day," one elder said. The atmosphere made it clear: their trust in him ran deep, based on his obvious concern for the community.</p>

<p>Dalos's face turned somber as he addressed Jason. "We give you one week to prepare for this duel. Given your lost memory, it would be a dishonor to fight an unprepared opponent."</p>

<p>Jason's internal monologue churned with thoughts. "One week? Does that mean five or seven days in this world? No, don't ask, you'll sound like an idiot." Then another thought popped up. "One week? Who are they kidding? I'd need at least five years to prepare for this! I only have experience in video game fights."</p>

<p>Jason's face remained composed, not betraying the inner turmoil. "Thank you for the honor of preparation time. I'll make the best of it," he managed to say, swallowing hard.</p>

<p>The mood in the village was tense as people went off to do their own things, knowing something important was coming up. Breaking the silence, Dalos spoke up. "Let me guide you back to the guest room. You'll need a place to rest and prepare."</p>

<p>Seizing the opportunity, Jason exclaimed his request before they could leave the public area. "Um, may I request an introduction to how magic works in this land? It might help jog my memory," he lied, trying to sound as earnest as possible.</p>

<p>The room filled with exchanged glances, a mix of curiosity and doubt hanging in the air. Dalos took a moment before nodding. "Very well, if you think it'll help you remember, it might be worth a shot."</p>

<p>Jason's shoulders relaxed, a subtle shift as if a weight had been lifted. Understanding the magic system would give him a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Dalos led Jason into a room adorned with mystical symbols and ancient scrolls. "Sit, sit," he said, gesturing to a cushioned seat. "Now, let me explain the core of magic. You see, we chant the words of the gods to channel our spiritual energy into magic. It's simple, really."</p>

<p>Jason couldn't help but think, "Simple? Oh, you mean just like explaining quantum physics to a 5-year-old.</p>

<p>Dalos gestured, and three individuals entered the room, their behavior solemn as though they were about to perform a sacred rite.</p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce the core magics of the Fendtorn race," Dalos announced. "We specialize in three main types: creating materials, manipulating these created materials, and enhancing them."</p>

<p>As Dalos's guests prepared themselves, Jason discreetly activated his 'Eye of Debugger,' hoping to uncover the deeper mechanisms behind this so-called magic.</p>

<p>The practitioners lined up, each focused, waiting for their moment. The first one stepped forward, extending their hands and closing their eyes. "Watch closely," Dalos whispered, the room silent but for his voice.</p>

<p>The first practitioner began:</p>

<p>"From the cosmic forge, to steel I declare,<br>
Iron and carbon, in elements paired.<br>
Tags and attributes, in harmony soar,<br>
Compile into being, as steel I restore."</p>

<p>A piece of steel materialized out of thin air, floating before them. Jason's eyes widened, captivated by what seemed like a miracle. The first practitioner stepped back, their task complete.</p>

<p>Dalos gestured subtly, and the second practitioner advanced. Hands hovering over the floating steel, they took a deep breath and continued:</p>

<p>"By selector‚Äôs grace, to sword you shall bend,<br>
Curves and lines, in styles that I send.<br>
Radius smooth, yet structure defined,<br>
Transitions complete, in sword you're designed."</p>

<p>The steel morphed into the shape of a sword. Jason felt a surge of disbelief and wonder.</p>

<p>With a slight bow, the third practitioner advanced. Meeting Jason's eye briefly, they began the final chant:</p>

<p>"Function sharpen invoked, edge fine-tuned to the core,<br>
Increment sword strength, like a variable I store.<br>
Callbacks to the hilt, and to the blade's keen sight,<br>
Await your power, to unleash warrior's might."</p>

<p>The sword emitted a radiant glow. Its form became robust, its blade razor-sharp. Jason could hardly contain his awe.</p>

<p>Throughout the demonstration, Jason noticed something peculiar. The incantations they chanted sounded eerily like a script in a programming language. Each syllable, each phrase seemed to represent a command that transformed characters‚Äîcode‚Äîinto something palpable and real. His background as a web developer made it all the more fascinating and uncanny.</p>

<p>'Are they... Are they literally coding reality?' Jason pondered, his mind racing. 'This is like HTML and CSS but on steroids.'</p>

<p>His "Eye of Debugger" revealed something even more intriguing. This wasn't magic in the conventional sense‚Äîit was science, just a form of science this world hadn't realized yet. Everything seemed to revolve around bytes or some other unit of data. The incantations were like algorithms, manipulating these units into forming matter and effects, and spiritual energy was a form of computational resource.</p>

<p>Jason grinned to himself, 'If magic here is just another form of coding, then I have a shot at this. After all, I'm a wizard in my own right‚Äîa code wizard.'</p>

<p>"As with all things, there are limitations," Dalos said, eyes twinkling with wisdom. "Our magic has a lifespan; the effects last only for around ten minutes. Hence, we also train rigorously in physical combat to supplement our abilities."</p>

<p>Jason nodded with clearer understanding. "So they're like programmer-samurais...or nija, blending magic and weaponry. Ten minutes could be a limitation, but it all depends on how they use it."</p>

<p>"Thank you for this invaluable information, Dalos," Jason said earnestly. "Do you happen to know where I could train? I really need to get the hang of this before... you know, the whole duel thing."</p>

<p>Dalos nodded, a look of understanding in his eyes. "I'd recommend heading straight to the training ground located just behind the village hall," he said, pointing him in the direction of the exit.</p>

<p>Jason made his way through the village, his eyes scanning for the hall Dalos mentioned. Upon finding it, he spotted an open area filled with training dummies and wooden weapons. His footsteps quickened as he approached, and soon he was in the heart of the training ground.</p>

<p>Not being able to remember any of the incantations, Jason decided to focus on how the 'Eye of Debugger' could be used for battle. Jason settled into a chair, staring intently at a spear lying a few feet away from him. "Alright, Spear, tell me your secrets. What properties do you possess that could help me survive a duel? Maybe you have some kind of hidden power or... Oh man, I can't believe I'm talking to a spear."</p>

<p>Jason moved closer and studied the spear's properties, his attention landing on its 'position' attribute. "Can I manipulate this thing remotely?" he pondered. Focusing intently, he tried to update the spear's coordinates using just his imagination. The minutes felt like hours, each failed attempt melting away at his confidence.</p>

<p>Just when he was about to give up, he noticed something‚Äîthe spear quivered an inch off the ground each time his gaze wandered. Energized by the clue, he fixed his gaze at a point a few feet away and visualized the spear levitating. After a struggle that seemed like an eternity, the spear lifted‚Äîjust a few inches off the ground.</p>

<p>From a distance, Jason looked like he was daydreaming or slacking off, but in his mind, a battle raged on.</p>

<p>Gurlan glanced over and scoffed. "He's doing nothing, just slacking," he thought. Annoyed, he yelled, "Hey! What are you doing?!"</p>

<p>Jason's eyes, startled, snapped toward the source of the voice‚ÄîGurlan.</p>

<p>The moment Jason's eyes met Gurlan's, the spear‚Äîwhich had lifted just a few inches off the ground‚Äîshot through the air towards Gurlan at a startling speed. With amazing reflexes, Gurlan caught the spear just before it could make contact with his face.</p>

<p>Jason learned how to move an object, but he also moved himself in a difficult situation.</p>

<p>The spear, although intercepted by Gurlan's swift hands, resisted with an uncanny force. The levitating power infused by Jason made the spear jitter and wriggle in Gurlan's grasp, like a serpent trying to break free. Veins popped in Gurlan's arms, his muscles strained as he wrestled with the seemingly possessed weapon.</p>

<p>The square was silent, all eyes were locked on the tussle between the man and the levitating spear. The seconds stretched, the world seemed to slow down, and then, with a final determined heave, Gurlan slammed the spear into the ground, pinning it in place.</p>

<p>Gurlan's eyes locked onto Jason's, creating a strong tension in the air. "Well, that was unexpected. Perhaps you're not as pathetic as you look," he said, his words filled with a complexity that Jason couldn't quite figure out. Gurlan then turned away, and as he did, the corners of his mouth seemed to twitch upwards.</p>

<p>Jason squinted, his thoughts racing. 'Was that a smile? What's going on in his head?'</p>

<p>The unclear moment left him uneasy, casting a long shadow of doubt and making him even more nervous about the upcoming duel.</p>
