 #### - [C# Arrays](https://dev.to/zafarurakov/c-arrays-4acj) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h3>
  
  
  Introduction
</h3>

<p>Arrays are an essential data structure in C# that allow you to store and manipulate collections of elements of the same data type. Arrays provide a convenient way to work with multiple values under a single variable name.</p>

<p>In C#, arrays can be of various types, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and jagged arrays. This documentation will explore each type and provide clear examples to help you understand their usage.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  One-Dimensional Arrays
</h3>

<p><strong>Declaration and Initialization</strong><br>
One-dimensional arrays in C# are declared and initialized using square brackets "[]". Here's an example of declaring and initializing an integer array:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">5</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Creates an integer array with 5 elements</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Accessing Elements</strong><br>
You can access elements in a one-dimensional array using their index, starting from 0. For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">thirdNumber</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Accesses the third element (index 2)</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Example: Sum of Elements</strong><br>
Let's calculate the sum of elements in an integer array:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">num</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="p">+=</span> <span class="n">num</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="n">Console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">WriteLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Sum of elements: "</span> <span class="p">+</span> <span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

</div>





<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">Sum</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">elements</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">15</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  Multi-Dimensional Arrays
</h3>

<p><strong>Declaration and Initialization</strong><br>
Multi-dimensional arrays have multiple dimensions, typically represented as a matrix. You can declare and initialize them like this:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[,]</span> <span class="n">matrix</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Creates a 3x3 integer matrix</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Accessing Elements</strong><br>
Accessing elements in a multi-dimensional array requires specifying indices for each dimension:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="n">matrix</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// Accesses the element in the first row and first column</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Example: Matrix Multiplication</strong><br>
Let's perform matrix multiplication using multi-dimensional arrays:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[,]</span> <span class="n">matrixA</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">2</span> <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<h3>
  
  
  Jagged Arrays
</h3>

<p>Jagged arrays are arrays of arrays, where each sub-array can have a different length. They are declared and initialized as follows:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[][]</span> <span class="n">jaggedArray</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">3</span><span class="p">][];</span>

<span class="n">jaggedArray</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span> <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="n">jaggedArray</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">9</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Accessing Elements</strong><br>
To access elements in a jagged array, you need to specify both the outer and inner indices:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="k">value</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">jaggedArray</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="m">1</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="m">2</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Accesses the third element of the second sub-array</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><strong>Example: Sum of Elements in Jagged Array</strong><br>
Let's calculate the sum of elements in a jagged integer array:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight csharp"><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[][]</span> <span class="n">jaggedArray</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">[][]</span> <span class="p">{</span>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>TL;DR: I created Realm (<a href="https://realm.codes">https://realm.codes</a>), a WebComponents-based framework that prioritizes simplicity and efficiency in frontend development. As a solo founder and product builder, I understand the importance of building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) quickly. That's why Realm doesn't rely on heavy tooling, transpilers, or complex setups.</p>

<p>Embraces the HTML Developer Manifesto, emphasizing clean and concise HTML code over excessive JavaScript. Realm offers a streamlined development experience and allows you to prototype and launch your ideas quickly. With features like reactive data binding and reusability, Realm empowers you to build dynamic web apps effortlessly.</p>




<p>You know, in the world of JavaScript, there's this belief that a new framework pops up every second. Developers are never satisfied with what exists and always end up reinventing the wheel. But you know what? It's actually a good thing. Innovation in other fields works the same way.</p>

<p>As a React / Next.js developer for the past four years (and still using it), I've often found myself struggling with the complexities of modern web development. Sure, there have been attempts in the past to reinvent things, like SSR (Server-Side Rendering) or RSC (React Server Components), can be done with old PHP way, but they're not quite the same. But it makes the web development more complex.</p>

<p>The complexity of modern web development has always bothered me. As someone building products, working on Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), I find myself caught up in endless tasks like setting up boilerplate code, organizing folders, and implementing best practices.</p>

<p>But then, I stumbled upon a post by <a href="https://x.com/levelsio">@levelsio</a> on X (<a href="https://x.com/levelsio/status/1675829733668319233">https://x.com/levelsio/status/1675829733668319233</a>). He was using jQuery and PHP, and his product shipped quickly without any issues. It made me realize that building a million-dollar MVP doesn't necessarily require a complex stack. It's all about having a clear vision for your product. The stack is just another piece of the puzzle.</p>

<p>The mindset of a founder or indie maker is different from that of a developer working at a startup. Best practices and scalability, in my opinion, aren't all that important during the MVP phase.</p>

<p>That's why I've always dreamt of creating a simple framework that ignores all the complexity and best practices. I miss the good old days of jQuery, where everything was just simple.</p>

<p>So, let's take a trip down memory lane and explore the evolution of web development, particularly on the frontend development.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Frontend Development Evolution
</h2>

<p>I witnessed most of the frontend development journey from the beginning, and I am grateful that today we have some awesome frameworks and libraries that have revolutionized the way we build user interfaces. We will recall of our memory about the evolution of frontend development and delve into the journeys of some prominent frameworks and libraries that have shaped the frontend world.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  jQuery
</h3>

<p>The jQuery Era marked a significant shift in frontend development. jQuery, released in 2006, quickly gained popularity due to its simplicity and ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) efficiently. It provided a concise syntax for traversing and manipulating HTML elements, handling events, and making AJAX requests. jQuery's widespread adoption made it the go-to library for many developers, and its influence can still be seen in countless legacy codebases.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  AngularJS
</h3>

<p>AngularJS, introduced by Google in 2010, brought a new paradigm to frontend development with its Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It offered a comprehensive framework for building dynamic web applications, providing features like two-way data binding, dependency injection, and reusable components. AngularJS gained popularity for its ability to handle complex applications and its strong community support.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Polymer
</h3>

<p>Polymer, developed by Google in 2013, introduced the concept of web components to frontend development. Web components enable developers to encapsulate and reuse UI elements across different projects. Polymer provided a set of tools and conventions to create and use web components, making it easier to build modular and maintainable frontend code. Polymer may not have reached the same level of popularity as some other frameworks, but it played a crucial role in paving the way for the future of web components. This inspired me to create Realm, a framework that embraces the power and potential of web components.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Vue, React, Svelte
</h3>

<p>The rise of Vue.js, React, and Svelte in recent years has transformed frontend development. Vue.js, released in 2014, offers a progressive framework that combines declarative rendering, component-based architecture, and a gentle learning curve. React, introduced by Facebook in 2013, revolutionized UI development with its virtual DOM and component-based approach. Svelte, released in 2016, takes a different approach by compiling components at build time, resulting in highly efficient and performant applications.</p>

<p>These frameworks have gained massive popularity due to their robust ecosystems, extensive community support, and developer-friendly features. They have significantly simplified frontend development and empowered developers to build complex and interactive user interfaces with ease.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  HTML Lit
</h3>

<p>HTML Lit, introduced by the Polymer team in 2019, is a lightweight library that enables developers to write web components using template literals. It combines the power of modern JavaScript with the simplicity of HTML templates, making it easier to create reusable components. HTML Lit embraces the native web platform and focuses on small file sizes and performance optimizations, making it an excellent choice for building fast and efficient web applications. This is the grandchild of Polymer, and I must say, I am truly enamored by the simplicity of this framework. The elegance and straightforwardness of HTMLLit have been a tremendous inspiration for the development of Realm.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  HTMX
</h3>

<p>HTMX is not just a meme, it‚Äôs real JS library. Everyone loved it. A relatively new addition to the frontend development landscape, focuses on enhancing traditional HTML applications with minimal JavaScript. It allows developers to add dynamic functionality to their websites by annotating HTML elements with attributes. HTMX uses AJAX requests to update parts of the page, providing a seamless user experience without the need for complex JavaScript frameworks. It emphasizes simplicity and developer ergonomics, making it a valuable tool for building modern web applications.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Introducing Realm: Reactive-Lightweight Markup Language
</h2>

<p>Let me get straight to the point. With Realm, all you need is a text editor and a browser. You don't even have to set up a localhost (although we might need that later, but it's not necessary if you don't import an element).</p>

<p>The heart and soul of Realm lies in defining custom elements that you can use anywhere, and it's only uses HTML element. That's where the magic happens.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight html"><code>
<span class="nt">&lt;custom-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"my-element"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;element-attr</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"string"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Default Name<span class="nt">&lt;/element-attr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;element-attr</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"dream"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"string"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Star<span class="nt">&lt;/element-attr&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;template&gt;</span>
    Hello my name is <span class="nt">&lt;slot</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"@name"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</span>,
    My dream: <span class="nt">&lt;slot</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"@dream"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/template&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/custom-element&gt;</span>

<span class="c">&lt;!-- Render it anywhere --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;my-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"Luffy"</span> <span class="na">dream=</span><span class="s">"King of Pirates"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;my-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"Nami"</span> <span class="na">dream=</span><span class="s">"Draw the map of the world"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;my-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"Zoro"</span> <span class="na">dream=</span><span class="s">"The Best Swordsman in the world"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;my-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"Sanji"</span> <span class="na">dream=</span><span class="s">"Finding the All Blue"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;my-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"Ussop"</span> <span class="na">dream=</span><span class="s">"The great warrior of the sea"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/my-element&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Realm draws inspiration from a mix of React, Polymer, jQuery, and all the other frameworks I mentioned in the Frontend Development Evolution section above.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight html"><code><span class="nt">&lt;custom-element</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"basic-counter"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;element-state</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"counter"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"number"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>0<span class="nt">&lt;/element-state&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;element-flow&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;trigger-event</span> <span class="na">click=</span><span class="s">"AddCountBtn"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;set-state</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"counter"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"1"</span> <span class="na">mutate=</span><span class="s">"+"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/set-state&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/trigger-event&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/element-flow&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;template&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">ref=</span><span class="s">"AddCountBtn"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      Add count <span class="nt">&lt;slot</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"#counter"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/template&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/custom-element&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>If you're curious about how this all works, you can dive into the <a href="https://realm.codes/docs/learn">Tutorial</a> on Realm's website. It will provide you with detailed insights and instructions on the process.</p>

<p>People love to joke about how there's no such thing as an "HTML developer" and that HTML is just a silly markup language. Well, I think it's time for them to stop laughing and start taking it seriously. It's time to take things to a whole new level.</p>

<p>I take great pride in calling myself an HTML developer, with a little help from JavaScript of course. In fact, I proudly declare the HTML Developer Manifesto.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  HTML Developer Manifesto
</h2>

<p>We, the HTML developers, stand united in our belief that HTML is not just a markup language but a versatile tool capable of building powerful web applications. We embrace the potential of HTML and its ecosystem to create innovative, interactive, and scalable solutions. We proudly present the HTML Developer Manifesto, showcasing the capabilities of HTML as a programming language:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>HTML is not limited to markup: We reject the notion that HTML is solely for structuring web content. With the advent of WebComponents, we can now create custom elements with attributes, state, reactivity, and reusability, all using HTML syntax. HTML is evolving beyond its origins and becoming a programming language in its own right.</p></li>
<li><p>Embracing the power of WebComponents: We harness the power of WebComponents to encapsulate functionality and create reusable building blocks. By defining custom elements, we can extend the vocabulary of HTML, enabling the creation of complex applications with less reliance on JavaScript.</p></li>
<li><p>State management in HTML: We recognize that state management is a crucial aspect of application development. With the help of HTML attributes and the power of WebComponents, we can maintain and manage state directly within our HTML code. This allows for cleaner and more declarative code, reducing the need for excessive JavaScript.</p></li>
<li><p>Reactivity through HTML attributes: We believe that interactivity is a fundamental requirement for modern applications. By leveraging HTML attributes, we can achieve reactivity within our components. Through event listeners and attribute-based triggers, we enable seamless updates and dynamic behavior without heavy JavaScript dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging CSS for styling and animation: We acknowledge that CSS plays a pivotal role in the visual presentation and user experience. By combining HTML's structure with the expressive power of CSS, we can create stunning interfaces and engaging animations, breathing life into our applications.</p></li>
<li><p>The spirit of reusability: We champion the concept of reusability in software development. By leveraging the modularity of WebComponents, we can create self-contained, encapsulated elements that can be easily reused across projects. This promotes efficiency, maintainability, and faster development cycles.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML as a gateway to accessibility: We recognize that building accessible applications is a moral imperative. HTML, with its built-in semantics, provides a solid foundation for creating inclusive experiences. By adhering to best practices and leveraging HTML's accessibility features, we ensure that our applications are usable by a diverse range of users.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration between HTML and JavaScript: We acknowledge that HTML and JavaScript are powerful allies in the pursuit of web development excellence. While HTML can handle many aspects of application logic, we recognize the need for JavaScript to handle complex computations, API interactions, and advanced functionalities. We encourage the harmonious collaboration of HTML and JavaScript to create robust and feature-rich applications.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We the HTML developers, stand firm in our belief that HTML is not merely a markup language but a programming language capable of creating sophisticated web applications. Together, let us push the boundaries of what can be achieved with HTML and build a more innovative, accessible, and inclusive web for all.</p>




<p>This is just the beginning. Once I complete the initial iteration to finish the first version, there's a lot of work ahead of me. I'll be focusing on improving the codebase and optimizing performance.</p>

<p>I've just introduced you to a concept, and who knows? Maybe there's something new that will draw inspiration from what I've created. The possibilities are endless!</p>

 #### - [Islands & Server Components & Resumability, Oh My!](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/islands-server-components-resumability-oh-my-319d) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>It is no secret that the past 2 years have seen the beginnings of a fairly dramatic change in frontend web technology. I write about these topics regularly. But as they enter the more mainstream vernacular I've found it has become more and more difficult to understand what these technologies are and differentiate when they are useful.</p>

<p>At the heart of the discussion is the topic of Hydration. The process in which a server-rendered website becomes interactive to the user in the browser. But even that is something that holds a somewhat vague understanding. What is it for an application to become interactive?</p>

<p>And Hydration is more significant than the amount of JavaScript we ship or execute. It impacts what data we need to serialize and send to the browser. This is an area that is not simple to build solutions for, and it is little surprise explaining them is equally challenging.</p>

<p>Now that more solutions have shipped I think it is time to revisit the 3 most promising approaches to this space.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  When does a Site become Interactive?
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JTGk7P_Q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oru6oigox10kssmlf4d4.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JTGk7P_Q--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/oru6oigox10kssmlf4d4.jpeg" alt="INP Graphic" width="800" height="472"></a></p>

<p>But first I think we need to start here. For such a seemingly simple question the answer isn't so straightforward. There is a reason performance experts in the browser, like the Chrome team, have gone through several iterations on how to best capture this. TTI (Time to Interactive), FID (First Input Delay), and now INP (Input to Next Paint) can also serve as a way to understand how responsive our websites are.</p>

<p>Looking at framework space there has been a lot of talk about Progressive Enhancement. I.e... having elements work if the JavaScript is not available (or available yet). Is a site considered interactive if clicking a button works in the sense it does a slower full-page navigation(server round trip) where it otherwise would have done stuff in the browser only?</p>

<p>How about if events are captured and then replayed during hydration or even used to prioritize what gets hydrated first as in the case of React 18's Selective Hydration? If the browser doesn't miss any end-user events but just doesn't respond right away because it is loading code, is that considered interactive?</p>

<p>The fact that these sorts of techniques are everywhere at this point is why at least to me being interactive can't only include the ability to catch the cause, but also the time it takes to witness the expected effect. How to measure that reasonably I will leave it to the browser teams, but that should give us goalposts for our exploration.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Islands
</h2>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A-Y63sDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4lteo95ma15ugimwn9pj.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--A-Y63sDH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4lteo95ma15ugimwn9pj.jpg" alt="Islands" width="800" height="534"></a></p>

<p>The thing to love about Islands is they start so simple. If you have too much JavaScript, divide and conquer. The earliest days of client-side rendering involved embedding interactive widgets in server-rendered applications. Even things like Web Components have made this pretty easy to do over the years. </p>

<p>Well, except for one problem. These widgets were client-rendered so they came from the server blank. This could cause layout shifts and a delay in primary content showing. Islands in the basic form is just server rendering these pieces as well.</p>

<p>Simple, but it meant JavaScript on the server to render which is why outside of Marko(2014), we did not see much exploration here until the more common SPA (Single Page App) server rendered had proven JavaScript full-stack was viable. Not until 2021 with frameworks like Astro, and Fresh did we see a return to this.</p>

<p>There are some significant differences between Islands and its SPA counterparts (like Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Remix). These Islands frameworks skip sending JavaScript for the root of the application. It isn't until you hit an interactive component that JavaScript is needed. This can drastically shrink bundle sizes.</p>

<p>Islands can also shrink HTML document size as they only need to serialize the data passed as Island props instead of all the data. That blob of JSON in a script tag we are accustomed to seeing at the bottom of the server-rendered HTML can disappear when we use Islands! On data-heavy pages, I've seen it cut the page size in half.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2m-db4fR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyjkr8xcdh3fdelh9c1b.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--2m-db4fR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zyjkr8xcdh3fdelh9c1b.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="431"></a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>How is that possible? Server-rendered children can be passed through the Islands without being hydrated themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rx4qA8nW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wa0407e1o39f85jbpabf.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rx4qA8nW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/wa0407e1o39f85jbpabf.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="576"></a></p>

<p>In the case above, where no state is passed to our ToggleVisibleIsland, those comments never need to be sent to the client.</p>

<p>It does mean though that any content passed through will be rendered eagerly even if it isn't shown ultimately at the opportunity that Island logic could display it later. So we only solve the "double data" problem if this content is only rendered once whether it be in the DOM or as a serialized prop/slot. Not both.</p>

<p>The most important difference is Island architected applications are MPAs(Multi-Page Apps). The optimization is based on knowing that the code for non-interactive parts is never needed in the browser. Never rendered in the client. This is something a SPA router could never guarantee.</p>

<p>But what if we do want client routing? How much does that change the picture?</p>

<p>Adding client routing with server-rendered HTML doesn't change much on the surface. Solutions like Turbo or Flamethrower have been adding that for a bit of smoothness to MPAs. We've recently seen combining these sorts of techniques with the View Transition API to great effect.</p>

<p>But an MPA with client-side routing doesn't suddenly give you all the benefits of a SPA. Most notably in element and state persistence. On the surface, this might also seem straightforward but it is not.</p>

<p>The first thing you might do is mark elements as being persistent. And then when you swap your new markup replace the existing elements back in where an ID matches. But since the elements are temporarily removed this can lose DOM state like input focus when persisting. You could diff it and in so only replace what has changed and that might be sufficient.</p>

<p>Another consideration is global state in the client. Pretend you have a global counter that impacts how certain Islands render. If you load one page and increment it to 10. Then on navigation render the next page on the server, it will not know that the counter is 10 and render it as if it were 0. This could lead to hydration mismatches and break the application.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4diNX-X5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/io9fucz2at6eivue0149.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4diNX-X5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/io9fucz2at6eivue0149.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="322"></a></p>

<p>Unless you desire to send back all the global state back and forth between requests(and you really really don't), we can't ever render Islands on the server after the first-page load if we want to ensure things won't break when global state is involved.</p>

<p>This detail isn't important just for navigation. But any lazily inserted content prop/slot can no longer ensure hydration will work if global state has changed since it was originally server-rendered. This adds complexity to the logic for absorbing rendered templates that ensure double data doesn't happen as the Islands and static templates need to be separated at runtime.</p>

<p>Instead of wrestling with that, React Server Components invented their own serialization format and didn't bother solving the "double data" problem. Although it is the only non-experimental solution I know today that properly handles state persistence.</p>

<p>So Server Component architecture can be seen as Islands + Client Routing, but it involves more than tagging a client router or even View Transitions on an MPA. And in so deserves its own category when looking at how we build partially hydrated solutions.</p>

<p>I love resumability because it does come out of left field compared to a lot of the other research that has been going on over the past decade. Instead of looking at how to reduce the amount of code/hydration, it looks at changing what code executes.</p>

<p>Partially Hydrated solutions above in some cases can reduce code footprints up to 80-90% but it still treats that last bit very similar to everything we've seen before. What if we didn't execute any code on the client until we needed to? What if hydration returned to just attaching event handlers?</p>

<p>To do that we'd need to serialize not just the application state, but the internal state of the framework so that when any part is executed it could continue where it left off. When an event handler updates some state we just propagate that change without ever running the components the first time in the browser to initialize it. Afterall we already initialized it when we rendered on the server.</p>

<p>This is not easy to accomplish given the way we close over state when we write components, but it is solvable:<br>

<p>It also opens up more interesting patterns for lazy code loading since it doesn't need to be immediately present for hydration. However, if interactivity is as defined above, you don't want to be lazy loading anything critical because we still have to wait for it. Maybe just expensive things or things offscreen. In the basic case, a pretty similar heuristic to how you would choose to lazy load for any client-side architecture.</p>

<p>Of course, serializing everything could be pretty costly, not unlike the "double data" problem. So we would need a way to determine what can never change in the client. To do that resumable solutions tend to use Signals-based reactivity, often augmented by compilation. By tying updates to the data rather than the view hierarchy components no longer become the unit of code that is needed to run. And more so dead code can be tree-shaken along the reactive graph of data-dependencies.</p>

<p>Done well that seems pretty good. Once you enter this zone, it is easier to automate the split between client and server. But that alone doesn't solve problems like client-side routing.</p>

<p>Resumability's knowledge is still based on knowing what will always be on the server from an MPA standpoint. Unlike Islands that are explicit, with an automatic system any descendant of stateful conditional in the rendering has the potential to end up in the browser.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jgdGZIy---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ocs5l99pizu0ontfct4v.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--jgdGZIy---/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ocs5l99pizu0ontfct4v.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="354"></a></p>

<p>If one added client-side routing (a stateful decision high in the tree) a resumable solution on its own would load the same code on navigation as an SPA and require all the serialized data client side to render it.</p>

  Conclusion

<p>So I guess high level:</p>

<ul>
<li>Islands are an architecture that aims to reduce JavaScript footprint by up to ~90% by explicitly denoting what goes to the client.</li>
<li>Server Components architecture extends Islands with client-side routing and proper state preservation.</li>
<li>Resumability instead of focusing on how to reduce the amount that is hydrated, looks to instead remove the execution cost of hydration itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>So while seen as competitive these are actually complementary. They don't all solve the same issue completely but focus on a certain part of the problem.</p>

<p>Islands have gotten incredibly optimal at solving for code and data serialization size. Server Component solutions today are the only Island-like solutions that properly account for state while client navigating. Resumability is the only approach that reduces the execution cost of the hydration that remains.</p>

<p>Whether these all converge is another question. Do Islands want the added complexity of Server Components? Will Server Components care about the last stage optimizations that come from Resumability? Will Resumable Solutions ever embrace explicitly calling out which parts of the view render in different locations?</p>

<p>I'm not sure. There is still a lot of room to explore. And honestly, it is still unclear to what extent these concerns impact final site performance or ideal developer experience. But it is an exciting time to be in web development as the future unfolds.</p>
