 #### - [🐬Top 5 MySQL GUI Clients to Command MySQL⚡️](https://dev.to/bytebase/top-5-mysql-gui-clients-to-command-mysql-8lf) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>To interact with MySQL databases, it’s common to employ MySQL GUI clients. They enable users to visually view, create and modify database objects such as tables, rows, and columns. Some familiar features of MySQL GUI clients include SQL generator and export data, which makes designing, creating, and administering MySQL databases easier and more convenient. Here, we gathered 5 best MySQL GUI Clients on the market right now.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Official: MySQL Workbench
</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> is a free database design and model access tool for MySQL, meant for database architects, developers, and of course, DBAs. It is available on Windows, Linux, as well as MacOS. Since the official MySQL vendor offers it, it looks like it's going to be free and maintained for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33G1BbQM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lgvs92n5sg49txtwfaia.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33G1BbQM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lgvs92n5sg49txtwfaia.png" alt="mysql-workbench" width="800" height="480"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Old School: phpMyAdmin
</h3>

<p>phpMyAdmin is a web-based interface to MySQL and MariaDB written in PHP that was first released back in 1998. It's open-source and free to use. For over 20 years, phpMyAdmin remains one of the most popular administration tools for MySQL databases, with a large community of users and contributors.</p>

<p>A range of features are available (managing databases, tables, users, permissions, etc) and can be performed via the user-friendly interface, you can also execute SQL queries directly. However, being web-based has pros and cons: phpMyAdmin is available on all the platforms with a web browser, yet it can be prone to security attacks such as SQL injection, so make sure to take proper precautionary measures.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MIkjGHNo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gcp5bp0qt0v43bp338rx.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--MIkjGHNo--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gcp5bp0qt0v43bp338rx.png" alt="phpmyadmin" width="800" height="573"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Power Couple: Navicat &amp; DBeaver
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Navicat
</h3>

<p><a href="https://navicat.com/">Navicat</a>'s first release came in 2002 and back then, it was a simple application only available for MySQL on Windows. Now it's available on macOS and Linux, with a long list of compatible databases, including Redis, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB, SQLite, MongoDB, and a handful of cloud databases.</p>

<p>It is not open-source, nor does it have a free offering, you can only choose between the premium and lite (with a compact list of features and database support as compared to the premium versions.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kD234wI5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8erdfn6bmsxau33zncs8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kD234wI5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8erdfn6bmsxau33zncs8.png" alt="navicat" width="800" height="480"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  DBeaver
</h3>

<p>Unlike Navicat, which only offers commercial versions, <a href="https://dbeaver.io/">DBeaver</a> offers both open-source and commercial products. It started as a hobby project back in 2010 and was open-sourced for use in 2013. The OS version caters to most database management and administration needs, while the commercial version extends the capabilities with additional advanced features like reverse engineering, data modeling, collaboration tools, and tech support.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sMFISfMT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tge97avtmiu6s0e4jrc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sMFISfMT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tge97avtmiu6s0e4jrc.png" alt="dbeaver" width="800" height="433"></a></p>

<p>Currently, it supports 80+ databases (SQL, NoSQL, document-oriented, key-value, big data, cloud, you name it). DBeaver is a desktop client, if you prefer web-based tools, they also have CloudBeaver.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Starlet: TablePlus
</h3>

<p>Starting in 2017, <a href="https://tableplus.com/">TablePlus</a> is the newbie on the list, and its modern and simple UI reflects it. It supports most relational databases and some NoSQL ones. When they just started, they only supported macOS, but it is now available on Windows, Linux, and iOS (!). It is not open-source, but the roadmap is open and anyone can open an issue on their GitHub Issue Tracker. TablePlus has two plans: a free tier (has no limit on trial time) and a paid subscription model (license) with extended features.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LbHuCqkc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjlgqijg064w9d5lqeoe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LbHuCqkc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjlgqijg064w9d5lqeoe.png" alt="tableplus" width="800" height="541"></a></p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that DBngin, a tool to <a href="https://www.bytebase.com/blog/free-tools-to-start-local-database-on-mac/">spin up a local database server</a> (currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis) on your Mac, is also TablePlus' and is open-source. You can connect DBngin to TablePlus to visually manage your local databases.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Bytebase
</h3>

<p>Any of the aforementioned provides a UI for users to operate on databases, a SQL Editor, and the ability to export data. On the other hand, if your organization needs are beyond those and demands an extra layer of control over database queries, changes, and admin actions, try out <a href="https://www.bytebase.com/">Bytebase</a>. </p>

 #### - [Leveling Up in OR: Excel Solver vs. Python](https://dev.to/balagmadhu/leveling-up-in-or-excel-solver-vs-python-388j) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>Intro</strong>:<br>
Operations Research, often referred to as OR, is a dynamic field at the intersection of mathematics, science, and decision-making. It was born out of the necessity to solve real-world problems during World War II, where military strategists needed better ways to allocate resources, plan logistics, and optimize their operations for maximum impact. Optimization is branch which is to  succeed with decision making in real-time, navigating through a maze of choices and constraints. Optimization in OR is like having a superpower that helps organizations make decisions that minimize costs, maximize profits, reduce waste, and streamline operations</p>

<p><strong>Real - world Concepts</strong>:<br>
The series <a href="https://dev.to/balagmadhu/series/23887">Optimization Simplified</a> we explored some of the real world examples. These real-world examples illustrate how optimization techniques play a crucial role in improving efficiency, reducing costs, and making informed decisions across various industries and sectors. They demonstrate the versatility and applicability of optimization in solving complex problems efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Considerations for Excel Solver</strong>:<br>
Excel Solver is a powerful tool for solving a wide range of optimization problems, particularly those that are relatively small to medium in size and don't require highly specialized algorithms. Solver proves most effective when you can decompose the larger problem into smaller components, allowing you to utilize Solver to prototype and establish the value proposition for a systemic solution.<br>
<em>Constraints with Solver</em>:<br>
1) The standard Microsoft Excel Solver has a limit of 200 decision variables<br>
2) Problems that involve both discrete (integer) and continuous decision variables, combined with nonlinear constraints, can be challenging <br>
3) Not suited for extremely complex optimization problems, especially those with a large number of decision variables and constraints. Would have performance impact due to memory and processing constraints<br>
Excel is set by default to use all cores it can. But it also depends on how your code and functions are written. But ifnot then enable in advance options<br>

 #### - [Generating Thumbnails from Videos using ApyHub’s API](https://dev.to/apyhub/generating-thumbnails-from-videos-using-apyhubs-api-p3k) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>As we have discussed in <a href="https://apyhub.com/blog/video-thumbnails-for-seo">previous articles</a>, video thumbnails have a lot of benefits and possible uses, including:</p>

<p>enhanced visual appeal, improved user experience, and of course a boost in brand identity and recognition. In this tutorial, we will go a bit more technical - focusing on the <a href="https://apyhub.com/utility/video-thumbnail">ApyHub video thumbnail</a> generator API.</p>

<p>No worries, this will be extremely simple and detailed. We will go slow and step by step, guiding you through every little detail. We will cover the API's core functionalities, including how to request thumbnails from videos using simple HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Moreover, we will show something cool: How to customize thumbnail dimensions and extract thumbnails from various time points within a video. Finally we will show how to seamlessly implement the generated thumbnails into your applications or websites</p>

<p>First things first - We'll start by importing packages and walk you through the process to execute the file using the Node.js command.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <strong>Step 1: Set up the project</strong>
</h3>

<p>Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the terminal<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="nx">mkdir</span> <span class="nx">video</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">thumbnail</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">api</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">nodejs</span>
<span class="nx">cd</span> <span class="nx">video</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">thumbnail</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">api</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">nodejs</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  Step 2: Initialize Node.js Project
</h3>

<p>Initialize a Node.js project by running the following command. This will create a package.json file.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="nx">npm</span> <span class="nx">init</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">y</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h3>
  
  
  Step 3: Install Required Packages
</h3>

<p>Install the required packages: Axios for making HTTP requests and form-data for handling multipart/form-data.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="nx">npm</span> <span class="nx">install</span> <span class="nx">axios</span> <span class="nx">form</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">data</span> <span class="nx">fs</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Once we run <code>npm install</code> in the terminal, the command triggers the installation of the specified dependencies listed in the project's package.json file. The following dependencies are commonly installed.</p>

<p><strong>axios:</strong> A popular HTTP client library for making HTTP requests in Node.js. It simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling responses. In this case, axios is used to make a POST request to the Video Watermarking API, sending the video URL and watermark image URL.</p>

<p><strong>form-data:</strong> form-data is a JavaScript library that provides a way to create and handle multipart/form-data requests. It allows you to easily construct and send HTTP requests that contain files or other binary data. This library is often used in conjunction with axios or other HTTP client libraries to send form-based requests with files attached.</p>

<p><strong>fs (File System)</strong>: A built-in module in Node.js that provides functionalities for working with the file system. In this context, fs is used to create a write stream and save the watermarked video file. The createWriteStream function allows you to write the response data from the API request directly to a file on the local file system.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step 4: Create Your Integration Script
</h3>

<p>Create a file named <strong>generateThumbnail.js</strong> in your project directory.<br>
</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Execute the Script</strong></p>

<p>Execute the script using the Node.js command.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">

<p>That's it! It wasn't so difficult right? We have now successfully integrated the <a href="https://apyhub.com/utility/video-thumbnail">Video Thumbnail API</a> using Node.js!</p>

<p>Using this service, we can generate video thumbnails from literally any part of a video file or URL (e.g. youtube). This way, we automate extracting thumbnails from videos , allowing for efficient and consistent extraction of thumbnails without the need of any manual work. This can save both time and resources for all businesses and content creators. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://apyhub.com/utility/video-thumbnail">ApyHub Video Thumbnail API</a> can also be integrated into existing workflows and platforms, making it easy to incorporate thumbnail extraction into existing processes.<br>
Good luck with using the API. Looking forward to any feedback on <a href="https://discord.gg/KcjnPHef7p">discord</a>.</p>
