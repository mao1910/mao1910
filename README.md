 #### - [🐬Top 5 MySQL GUI Clients to Command MySQL⚡️](https://dev.to/bytebase/top-5-mysql-gui-clients-to-command-mysql-8lf) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>To interact with MySQL databases, it’s common to employ MySQL GUI clients. They enable users to visually view, create and modify database objects such as tables, rows, and columns. Some familiar features of MySQL GUI clients include SQL generator and export data, which makes designing, creating, and administering MySQL databases easier and more convenient. Here, we gathered 5 best MySQL GUI Clients on the market right now.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Official: MySQL Workbench
</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> is a free database design and model access tool for MySQL, meant for database architects, developers, and of course, DBAs. It is available on Windows, Linux, as well as MacOS. Since the official MySQL vendor offers it, it looks like it's going to be free and maintained for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33G1BbQM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lgvs92n5sg49txtwfaia.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--33G1BbQM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lgvs92n5sg49txtwfaia.png" alt="mysql-workbench" width="800" height="480"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Old School: phpMyAdmin
</h3>

<p>phpMyAdmin is a web-based interface to MySQL and MariaDB written in PHP that was first released back in 1998. It's open-source and free to use. For over 20 years, phpMyAdmin remains one of the most popular administration tools for MySQL databases, with a large community of users and contributors.</p>

<p>A range of features are available (managing databases, tables, users, permissions, etc) and can be performed via the user-friendly interface, you can also execute SQL queries directly. However, being web-based has pros and cons: phpMyAdmin is available on all the platforms with a web browser, yet it can be prone to security attacks such as SQL injection, so make sure to take proper precautionary measures.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Power Couple: Navicat &amp; DBeaver
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Navicat
</h3>

<p><a href="https://navicat.com/">Navicat</a>'s first release came in 2002 and back then, it was a simple application only available for MySQL on Windows. Now it's available on macOS and Linux, with a long list of compatible databases, including Redis, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, MariaDB, SQLite, MongoDB, and a handful of cloud databases.</p>

<p>It is not open-source, nor does it have a free offering, you can only choose between the premium and lite (with a compact list of features and database support as compared to the premium versions.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kD234wI5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8erdfn6bmsxau33zncs8.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--kD234wI5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8erdfn6bmsxau33zncs8.png" alt="navicat" width="800" height="480"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  DBeaver
</h3>

<p>Unlike Navicat, which only offers commercial versions, <a href="https://dbeaver.io/">DBeaver</a> offers both open-source and commercial products. It started as a hobby project back in 2010 and was open-sourced for use in 2013. The OS version caters to most database management and administration needs, while the commercial version extends the capabilities with additional advanced features like reverse engineering, data modeling, collaboration tools, and tech support.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sMFISfMT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tge97avtmiu6s0e4jrc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--sMFISfMT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4tge97avtmiu6s0e4jrc.png" alt="dbeaver" width="800" height="433"></a></p>

<p>Currently, it supports 80+ databases (SQL, NoSQL, document-oriented, key-value, big data, cloud, you name it). DBeaver is a desktop client, if you prefer web-based tools, they also have CloudBeaver.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  The Starlet: TablePlus
</h3>

<p>Starting in 2017, <a href="https://tableplus.com/">TablePlus</a> is the newbie on the list, and its modern and simple UI reflects it. It supports most relational databases and some NoSQL ones. When they just started, they only supported macOS, but it is now available on Windows, Linux, and iOS (!). It is not open-source, but the roadmap is open and anyone can open an issue on their GitHub Issue Tracker. TablePlus has two plans: a free tier (has no limit on trial time) and a paid subscription model (license) with extended features.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LbHuCqkc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjlgqijg064w9d5lqeoe.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--LbHuCqkc--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pjlgqijg064w9d5lqeoe.png" alt="tableplus" width="800" height="541"></a></p>

<p>It's worth mentioning that DBngin, a tool to <a href="https://www.bytebase.com/blog/free-tools-to-start-local-database-on-mac/">spin up a local database server</a> (currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Redis) on your Mac, is also TablePlus' and is open-source. You can connect DBngin to TablePlus to visually manage your local databases.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Bytebase
</h3>

<p>Any of the aforementioned provides a UI for users to operate on databases, a SQL Editor, and the ability to export data. On the other hand, if your organization needs are beyond those and demands an extra layer of control over database queries, changes, and admin actions, try out <a href="https://www.bytebase.com/">Bytebase</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vn07wTII--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g6ltowca2e2gji3h00hn.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Vn07wTII--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/g6ltowca2e2gji3h00hn.png" alt="bytebase" width="800" height="609"></a></p>

<p>Bytebase is an <a href="https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase">open-source</a> Database DevOps and CI/CD tool for teams, designed to centralize the control and secure your organization’s most valuable asset, the database data.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PaGP0e_E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nyepzl0wh9tulvpsrf4w.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PaGP0e_E--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nyepzl0wh9tulvpsrf4w.gif" alt="wink" width="498" height="498"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Final Thoughts
</h3>

<p>MySQL GUI Clients can be used to help you manage databases with more confidence. However, the best-fit tool depends on your level of familiarity with MySQL, and what you need to accomplish in the tool.</p>

 #### - [How I Went Viral](https://dev.to/mohammadfaisal/how-i-went-viral-e5p) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong><em>To read more articles like this, <a href="https://www.mohammadfaisal.dev/blog">visit my blog</a></em></strong></p>

<p>7 months ago on a cold evening, I was sitting idly on my desk and thinking of doing something productive.</p>

<p>Suddenly the brilliant idea of writing an article hit my mind. Although I didn’t write anything in my life up to that point.</p>

<p>The medium was the obvious choice for writing because I read a lot of articles on Medium because of my job as a Software Engineer.</p>

<p>So I started writing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How it Happened
</h2>

<p>My initial intention was to document the journey of myself as a software engineer. Also having a blogging portfolio can prove to my employers that I know what I am doing.</p>

<p>On average the articles were viewed around 6–12 times per day and I thought to myself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW! People are spending their time reading my stuff!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It felt so good. But after some days suddenly my view count went from 20 to 500!</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VqBEBZAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A73WYw_fXIVC-VuLNHJ69QQ.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VqBEBZAB--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1%2A73WYw_fXIVC-VuLNHJ69QQ.png" alt="My first spike" width="740" height="270"></a></p>

<p>It gathered a huge amount of views afterward and to this day it accumulates over <strong>30000</strong> <strong>views</strong>. That’s <strong>viral</strong> for me!</p>

<p>It was a story about our mistake as startup founders. How some poor technical choice almost ruined us.</p>

<p>[Costly Mistakes: Why We Had to Abandoned Firebase]( javascript.plainenglish.io](<a href="https://javascript.plainenglish.io/costly-mistakes-why-we-had-to-abandoned-firebase-b89930c10d92">https://javascript.plainenglish.io/costly-mistakes-why-we-had-to-abandoned-firebase-b89930c10d92</a> )</p>

<p>Whatever the case it felt so good. And I became much more serious after that about writing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Though?
</h2>

<p>Honestly, at that time, I had absolutely no idea why this particular article went viral.</p>

<p>But now, after 6 months I think I’m now in a better place to explain why that article went viral. And these are factors that I used my other viral stories too. So maybe there is something.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  1. This is a Story of Failure
</h2>

<p>This story is about <strong>failure</strong>. People love to hear about other people’s failures. One of my most favorite quotes is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not enough to succeed; others must fail — Gore Vidal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it’s true. No matter how much you want to avoid the truth it’s actually true.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--akpUdWau--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11520/1%2AT-s5uiIdryQ9RC1oWIp_xA.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--akpUdWau--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/11520/1%2AT-s5uiIdryQ9RC1oWIp_xA.jpeg" alt="Photo by [Nathan Cowley](https://www.pexels.com/@mastercowley?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels) from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-in-blue-and-brown-plaid-dress-shirt-touching-his-hair-897817/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels)" width="800" height="533"></a></p>

<p>This is explained in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/in-the-name-love/200901/why-are-we-pleased-others-misfortune">this article </a>very nicely. And I think this is a factor why people <strong>engaged</strong> with that particular article.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  2. Powerful Word in The Title
</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://kajabi.com/blog/power-words">this website</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>power word</strong> (also sometimes confused as a trigger <strong>word</strong>) is a <strong>word</strong> that evokes an emotion and a response. It instills in people the desire or need to respond to whatever you’re presenting them with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used the word <strong>“Abandon”</strong> in the title which is a <strong>power word</strong>. It was a spontaneous choice back then but later I found out it’s an important factor in writing a <strong>great title</strong> for your article.</p>

<p>I think this word in the title <strong>triggered</strong> many people to click on the article.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Against Popular Opinion
</h3>

<p>In my article, I talked about the technology <strong>Firebase.</strong> Which is loved by many people and for good reasons. There are tons of articles about why it’s great and all.</p>

<p>But unfortunately in our case, we failed to make the most out of it. That’s why people got curious about how we failed.</p>

<p>Many people in the comments also expressed their anger and pointed out why it was our fault that we failed to utilize it. (But forgot that I wrote the article to explain just that :p )</p>

<h3>
  
  
  4. Luck
</h3>

<p>Well….. most probably you saw it coming.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not trying to pretend to be a wizard who just figured out the algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all the things that you can do there is still a crucial factor that is <strong>LUCK.</strong> Maybe some of my other articles had similar <strong>juices</strong> as that first article but didn’t take off.</p>

<p>And that’s life for you. Write more consistently and write the best version that you possibly can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it’s the only thing that is in your control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best of luck with your writing journey. I hope you enjoyed it reading as much as I enjoyed writing it.</p>
