<p>You are given an integer array <code>height</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two <code>endpoints</code> of the <code>ith</code> line are <code>(i, 0)</code> and <code>(i, height[i]).</code><br>
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.<br>
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.<br>
Notice that you may not slant the container.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
Input: height = <code>[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]</code><br>
Output: <code>49</code><br>
Explanation: <code>The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</code></p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
Input: height = <code>[1,1]</code><br>
Output: <code>1</code></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Intuition:
</h2>

<p>The code aims to find the maximum area between two lines in a histogram, where the lines represent the heights of bars.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Approach:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Initialize pointers at both ends of the histogram (LeftPointer at 0 and RightPointer at the last element).</li>
<li>While the LeftPointer is less than the RightPointer:</li>
<li>Calculate the area between the lines formed by the heights at LeftPointer and RightPointer.</li>
<li>Update the MaximumArea if the current area is greater.</li>
<li>Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward (towards the other pointer).</li>
<li>Repeat step 2 until the pointers meet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Complexity:
</h2>

<p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(n) where n is the number of elements in the height array. We iterate through the array once.<br>
<strong>Space complexity:</strong> O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Code:
</h2>



<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int MaximumArea = 0;
        int LeftPointer = 0;
        int RightPointer = height.length - 1;

        while(LeftPointer &lt; RightPointer){
            if(height[LeftPointer] &lt; height[RightPointer]){
                MaximumArea = Math.max(MaximumArea , height[LeftPointer] *(RightPointer - LeftPointer));
                LeftPointer++;
            }
            else{
                MaximumArea = Math.max(MaximumArea ,height[RightPointer] *(RightPointer - LeftPointer));
                RightPointer--;
            }
        }

        return MaximumArea;

 #### - [Rest VS gRPC](https://dev.to/hasanelsherbiny/rest-vs-grpc-1bj3) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Since the first appearance of API there has been many approaches to make it simpler and much powerful and easy to use.<br>
if you don't know <a href="https://dev.to/hasanelsherbiny/what-is-api-21bc">what is API read this article</a></p>

<p>this is a quick comparison between REST And gRPC APIS</p>

<p>REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. <br>
It is not a protocol, but a set of constraints and principles for creating web services.</p>

<p>REST APIs are built considering these concepts:<br>
Resources: In REST, everything is a resource, which can be a physical object, a piece of data or a service. <br>
Each resource is identified by a uniqu URL.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>HTTP Methods: <br>
REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resourcs</p></li>
<li><p>Stateless:<br>
RESTful APIs are statelss, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfil the request</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3.Representation: <br>
Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, which clients can request based on their needs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose REST?
</h2>

<p>Simplicity: REST is easy to understand and implement making it a popular choice for web APIs</p>

<p>Language Agnostic: Clients and servers can be written in different programming languages promoting interoperability.</p>

<p>Caching: REST leverage HTTP caching mechanisms for better performance.</p>

<p>Maturity: REST has been around for a long time and has widespread support in various web frameworks and tools.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Drawbacks of REST
</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Overfetching / Underfetching: Clients may receive more or less data than they need impacting efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p>Latency: Multiple round-trips can result in higher latency when dealing with complex operations.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>
  
  
  So What Is gRPC?
</h2>

<p>gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework developed by Google that allows you to define RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services and generate client-server code for multiple programming languages. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for data serialization and HTTP/2 for transport.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose gRPC?
</h2>

<p>1.IDL (Interface Definition Language): <br>
gRPC uses a language-agnostic IDL to define services and message types. These definitions can then be used to generate client and server code in multiple languages.</p>

<p>2.Strongly Typed: <br>
Data serialization with protobufs is strongly typed reducing the chances of runtime errors due to data mismatches.</p>

<p>3.HTTP/2: <br>
gRPC uses HTTP/2 for transport, offering features like multiplexing, flow control, and header compression which enhance performance.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why To Choose gRPC?
</h2>

<p>1.Bidirectional Streaming: <br>
gRPC supports bidirectional streaming allowing both the client and server to send a stream of messages.</p>

<p>2.Efficiency: <br>
gRPC's use of HTTP/2 and binary serialization makes it highly efficient in terms of bandwidth and latency.</p>

<p>3.Code Generation: <br>
gRPC automatically generates client and server code reducing the likelihood of human error.</p>

<p>4.Strong Typing: <br>
Protobufs ensure strong typing and versioning of data contracts.</p>

<p>5.Bidirectional Streaming: <br>
Ideal for real-time applications and chat systems.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Drawbacks of gRPC
</h2>

<p>1.Complexity: <br>
The additional complexity of protobuf definitions and code generation can be challenging for some developers.</p>

<p>2.Learning Curve: <br>
Learning to work with gRPC may require additional time and effort.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  When To Choose REST OR gRPC?
</h2>

<p>This depends project's requirements and constraints but</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Use REST if:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>You need simplicity and quick development.</li>
<li>Your clients and servers are implemented in different languages.</li>
<li>You want to leverage the maturty and existing support of REST in web frameworks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Use gRPC if:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>You prioritize efficiency and low latency.</li>
<li>You have strong typing and versioning requirements.</li>
<li>Bidirectional streaming or real-time communication is essential.</li>
<li>You want to benefit from code generation and maintainable APIs.</li>
</ul>
