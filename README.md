<h2>
  
  
  Preparing for the Migration
</h2>

<p>Before you dive into the migration process, it's essential to make adequate preparations. Follow these steps:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Backup Your Website
</h3>

<p>The first and most crucial step in any migration is backing up your website. You can use plugins like UpdraftPlus or BackWPup to simplify this process. Ensure you have a copy of your website files and the database.<br>

<h3>
  
  
  Choose a New Hosting Provider
</h3>

<p>Research and select a new hosting provider that suits your needs. Consider factors like server speed, uptime, customer support, and scalability. Popular choices include Bluehost, SiteGround, and HostGator.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Update WordPress and Plugins
</h3>

<p>Ensure that your WordPress core and all plugins are up to date. Outdated software can lead to compatibility issues during migration.</p>



<h2>
  
  
  The Migration Process
</h2>

<p>Now that you're prepared, let's dive into the actual migration process:</p>

<h3>
  
  
  1. Export Your Website's Content
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your WordPress dashboard.</li>
<li>Navigate to 'Tools' and select 'Export.'</li>
<li>Choose 'All content' and click 'Download Export File.'</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  
  
  2. Create a New Database on the New Host
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your new hosting cPanel.</li>
<li>Find the 'Databases' section and select 'MySQL Databases.'</li>
<li>Create a new database and a new user with full privileges.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  
  
  3. Import Your Content
</h3>

<ol>
<li>In your new hosting cPanel, go to 'phpMyAdmin.'</li>
<li>Select your new database and click 'Import.'</li>
<li>Upload the database file you exported earlier.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
  
  
  4. Update Your DNS Records
</h3>

<p>Contact your domain registrar and update your DNS records to point to the new hosting provider's nameservers. This step may take some time to propagate.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  5. Upload Your Website Files
</h3>

<p>Use an FTP client like FileZilla to upload your website files to the new hosting server. Make sure to place them in the correct directory (usually public_html).</p>

<h3>
  
  
  6. Modify Your wp-config.php File
</h3>

<p>Edit your wp-config.php file on the new host to reflect the new database information.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  7. Test Your Website
</h3>

<p>Before finalizing the migration, thoroughly test your website on the new host. Ensure that all pages, links, and functionality are working correctly.</p>



<h2>
  
  
  Post-Migration Optimization
</h2>
<h3>
  
  
  8. Update Permalinks and Plugins
</h3>

<p>Log in to your WordPress dashboard on the new host and update your permalinks. Also, re-install and activate your plugins.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  9. Monitor and Troubleshoot
</h3>

<p>Keep a close eye on your website's performance post-migration. Resolve any issues promptly to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  10. Consider a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
</h3>

<p>To further enhance your website's speed and security, consider implementing a CDN like Cloudflare.</p>

 #### - [How I deployed my website as a container](https://dev.to/paschalogu/how-i-deployed-my-website-as-a-container-3fje) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>One of the greatest nightmares of developers is the ‚ÄúIt's not working on my machine‚Äù problem. I struggled to run my website locally on different machines too. Shout out to <strong><a href="https://github.com/britdm">Brittany Mitchell</a></strong> for giving me the idea to containerize my website. Containerization allowed me to build my website and run it consistently across different environments and machines. Docker is the tool for achieving this containerization.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M2LpCZ5j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmsimcyg8pul9mg5gsny.jpeg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M2LpCZ5j--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmsimcyg8pul9mg5gsny.jpeg" alt="Image Source: r/ProgrammerHumour" width="422" height="585"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  What is Docker?
</h2>

<p>Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It is a technology that allows you to incorporate and store your code and its dependencies into a neat little package called an image.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Dockerfile, Docker Image, and Docker Container
</h2>

<p><strong>Dockerfile:</strong></p>

<p>A Dockerfile is a text file containing a collection of commands or procedures. Consider this file as a script that defines how our container image will be built.</p>

<p><strong>Docker Image:</strong> </p>

<p>A docker image is a packaged, runnable instance of an application or environment. It contains everything needed to run a piece of software (or website in our case), including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. A docker image is read-only template for creating containers.</p>

<p><strong>Docker Container:</strong> </p>

<p>A docker container is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run the software. Containers isolate applications from each other and the underlying infrastructure while providing an added layer of protection for the application. Containerization solves the problem related to application deployment, and scalability. It helps promote consistency and efficiency in software development and operations. </p>

<h2>
  
  
  Here is how I containerized my website
</h2>

<p>As a prerequisite, ensure that you have docker installed locally on your machine. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Install Docker Engine</a></p>

<p>The code for my website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/paschalogu/personal-website">GitHub</a>.  To follow along, fork and clone this repository and change directory into it by running the commands below:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/paschalogu/personal-website.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>personal-website
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Step 1: Build the Docker image
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add a Dockerfile</li>
</ul>

<p>I created a new file named <strong>Dockerfile</strong> by running the command <code>touch Dockerfile</code> in the root of my website directory and added these lines of code below inside the Dockerfile:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>FROM nginx:alpine

COPY <span class="nb">.</span> /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>The <code>FROM nginx:alpine</code>  line tells Docker to create a Docker image based on the Nginx web server with Alpine Linux. The <code>COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html</code> line will copy the website content from the directory we are in into the image being built. This means that our website code will replace the default Nginx web server content. <code>EXPOSE 80</code> specifies that the container should be capable of serving HTTP traffic on port 80.</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Image</li>
</ul>

<p>Then I built the image by running the line of code below:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>docker build <span class="nt">-t</span> personal-website:v1 <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><code>docker build</code> command tells docker to build our website as an image based on the instructions provided in a Dockerfile above. The <code>-t personal-website:v1</code> tells docker to tag the image personal-website:v1. v1 signifies that this is version 1. The period (.) tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory and use the files and directories in this location during the build process. </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ovt85zgE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cfex7zs3l5jw7api0gss.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ovt85zgE--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cfex7zs3l5jw7api0gss.png" alt="Docker build" width="800" height="300"></a></p>

<p>Running the command <code>docker images</code>  shows this image I just built:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7S3K-uEd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xzyu65hrtc7tl488uou3.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--7S3K-uEd--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xzyu65hrtc7tl488uou3.png" alt="Image description" width="800" height="58"></a></p>




<h2>
  
  
  Step 2: Push to Docker Registry
</h2>

<p>I logged in to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub Container Image Library</a> and created a new repository.  I named it <code>personal-website</code> and gave it a short description (description is optional).</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OnlnRuKl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qjgw56xjhctsg836dxn4.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--OnlnRuKl--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qjgw56xjhctsg836dxn4.png" alt="Docker Registry" width="800" height="561"></a></p>

<p>Then I ran the <code>docker push</code> command below to push the image I built in the previous step, but it failed with the error below üòû.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>docker push paschalogu/personal-website:v1

The push refers to repository <span class="o">[[</span>docker.io/paschalogu/personal-website]<span class="o">(</span>http://docker.io/paschalogu/personal-website<span class="o">)]</span>
An image does not exist locally with the tag: paschalogu/personal-website
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Why did it fail? The push command was looking for an image named paschalogu/personal-website:v1, but didn't find one.</p>

<p>To fix this, I ran the <code>docker tag</code> command to tag my image and then re-ran the <code>docker push command</code> to push to my docker repository.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>docker tag personal-website:v1 paschalogu/personal-website:v1

docker push paschalogu/personal-website:v1
</code></pre>

</div>






<h2>
  
  
  Step 3: Test Configuration
</h2>

<p>Opened my browser and navigated to the website <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">https://labs.play-with-docker.com/</a> </p>

<p>Selected Login and then chose docker from the drop-down list. Then, I sign in with my Docker Hub account and clicked the Start button.</p>

<p>I clicked on ADD NEW INSTANCE option on the left sidebar. After a few seconds, a terminal window opened up in my browser.</p>

<p>In the terminal, I started my freshly pushed wevsite.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>docker pull paschalogu/personal-website:v1

docker run <span class="nt">-dp</span> 80:80 paschalogu/personal-website:v1
</code></pre>

</div>

It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.</p>

<p>Roadmaps are strategic plans that determine a goal or the desired outcome and feature the significant steps or milestones required to reach it.<br>
Therefore this is a roadmap to becoming a great data scientist.</p>

<p><u><strong>The Data Science Lifecycle</strong><br>
</u><br>
Data science‚Äôs lifecycle consists of five distinct stages, each with its own tasks:</p>

<p>1.Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction. This stage involves gathering raw structured and unstructured data.</p>

<p>2.Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture. This stage covers taking the raw data and putting it in a form that can be used.</p>

<p>3.Process: Data Mining, Clustering/Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization. Data scientists take the prepared data and examine its patterns, ranges, and biases to determine how useful it will be in predictive analysis.</p>

<p>4.Analyze: Exploratory/Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis. Here is the real meat of the lifecycle. This stage involves performing the various analyses on the data.</p>

<p>5.Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making. In this final step, analysts prepare the analyses in easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports.</p>

<p>Step 1: Query Language Like SQL<br><br>
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data stored in databases. It is a critical skill for any data scientist, as it allows you to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data from various sources. </p>

<p>Step 2: Programming Language Like R/ Python<br>
