 #### - [My #100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://dev.to/devencourt/my-100daysofcode-challenge-1d66) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h3>
  
  
  Past
</h3>

<p>I have had a really long, bumpy relationship with coding. I'm a naturally fast learner, so when I run into something with as many hurdles as coding, I've never had enough grit to make it through. Or at least, that's what I tell myself.</p>

<p>At the earliest stages of my journey, I had online profiles on chat sites that I customized with HTML and CSS before I even really understood what those were.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I traded my Physics courses for Computer Science courses. I got to learn web design and make my own games instead of doing math on paper, what a dream! At the peak of my high school tech career, I used a Logitech webcam and my own API to design something similar to a Ring doorbell before those really got popular. </p>

<p>Nowadays, I know enough about these technical topics to hold a conversation, but if you actually pressed me about some of them and held my feet to the fire, I probably wouldn't be able to give you solid answers. For my fellow Americans, if you had Spanish classes in high school and haven't spoken the language since, you'll know how I feel: a stuttering, bumbling mess.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Future
</h3>

<p>So, I want to make an effort to fix that. How are things going to change? </p>

<p>I've always struggled with motivation, but I've never struggled with passion. That, I've got buckets full of. So, let's take all that passion and turn it into something fruitful.</p>

<p>You all may have heard of the <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/dev-team-update-22c9">recent round of layoffs</a> at Forem last week. While I was unfortunately one of the unlucky few impacted, I'm not going to let that stop me from connecting with over one million of you amazing people each and every week. </p>

<p>I'm feeling motivated enough to do 100 Days of Code this October, so let's see how it'll turn out. With this post, I'm committing myself publicly to the challenge. Maybe a true developer will be born out of this venture.<br>
</p>
<div class="crayons-card c-embed text-styles text-styles--secondary">
    <div class="c-embed__body">
      <h2 class="fs-xl lh-tight">
        <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link">

      <div class="color-secondary fs-s flex items-center">
        100daysofcode.com
      </div>
    </div>
</div>


<p>I think this time, I have a few major motivations that will make the difference: </p>

<ol>
<li>I'm already at the best place to be a CodeNewbie: dev.to</li>
<li>I have dream projects I want to be able to turn into reality. </li>
<li>I'm willing to take it slow and understand that there are going to be a lot of things that I don't get the first go around. </li>
</ol>

<p>You can follow along with my daily progress on Twitter: </p>
<div class="crayons-card c-embed text-styles text-styles--secondary">
    <a href="https://twitter.com/bethenb1" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      twitter.com
    </a>
</div>


<p>I'll post weekly here so I don't spam you too much - and just to make it easier on the ol' wrists. 15 posts is a lot less than 100 posts. </p>

<p>If anyone has been waiting to make the effort to learn how to code, this is your sign! I'm following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, so you can feel free to learn along with me at your own pace. I'm inspired by all of you and hope that I can inspire some newbies myself along the way. </p>

 #### - [9 Common Security Vulnerabilities in Web Applications](https://dev.to/joymukherjee_18/9-common-security-vulnerabilities-in-web-applications-207) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Web applications have become integral to our daily lives, facilitating everything from online shopping to social interactions. However, the increasing complexity of web apps also brings a higher risk of security vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks can result in data breaches, service disruptions, and financial losses. To safeguard your web applications, it's crucial to understand and mitigate common security vulnerabilities. In this article, we'll explore nine of these vulnerabilities and discuss how to protect your web apps from them.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QLf2xa_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ysud3hw6tge9v2fcjk1h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QLf2xa_h--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ysud3hw6tge9v2fcjk1h.png" alt="Image description" width="600" height="400"></a></p>

<p><strong>1. Injection Attacks</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Injection attacks occur when malicious code is injected into an application's input fields, typically through user inputs or HTTP requests. The most common type is SQL Injection, where attackers manipulate database queries to access, modify, or delete data.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to sanitize user inputs, avoiding direct concatenation of data in queries. Employ web application firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block malicious requests.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal user data, session cookies, or manipulate website content.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Implement output encoding to sanitize user-generated content. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict script execution from untrusted sources. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP.</p>

<p><strong>3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> CSRF attacks trick users into performing actions without their consent when they are logged into a different website. Attackers can execute actions on behalf of users, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data loss.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Implement anti-CSRF tokens in web forms to verify that actions originated from the legitimate site. Validate and sanitize inputs on the server side.</p>

<p><strong>4. Broken Authentication</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Weak authentication mechanisms, like poorly protected credentials or session management, can lead to unauthorized access. Attackers may use stolen or brute-forced credentials to impersonate users.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use strong password policies and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible. Secure session management with secure cookies, token-based authentication, and session timeouts.</p>

<p><strong>5. Insecure Deserialization</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Insecure deserialization occurs when applications fail to properly validate and sanitize serialized data, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Avoid deserializing untrusted data. Implement whitelists for allowed classes and objects during deserialization. Keep your deserialization libraries up to date.</p>

<p><strong>6. Security Misconfiguration</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Misconfigurations can expose sensitive data, APIs, or admin interfaces to unauthorized access. Attackers exploit these mistakes to gain unauthorized access.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Regularly review and update your server, application, and database configurations. Employ security headers and frameworks like OWASP ModSecurity to catch common misconfigurations.</p>

<p><strong>7. Broken Access Control</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Insufficient access controls allow users to perform actions they shouldn't. Attackers may escalate their privileges to access restricted resources.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC) and ensure that users can only access what they are authorized to. Regularly audit access control policies.</p>

<p><strong>8. Sensitive Data Exposure</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Inadequately protected sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, can be accessed by attackers. This may occur due to weak encryption or storage practices.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using strong encryption algorithms). Store credentials securely, and never expose them in logs or error messages.</p>

<p><strong>9. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> Unvalidated redirects and forwards occur when applications forward users to untrusted URLs or pages. Attackers can use this to trick users into visiting malicious websites.</p>

<p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Avoid using redirects and forwards based on user inputs. If necessary, validate and sanitize the destination URLs. Implement a safe redirection mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Web application security is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and proactive measures. Understanding these common security vulnerabilities and following best practices, such as those outlined by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project), is crucial for protecting your web applications. Regular security testing, code reviews, and staying informed about emerging threats are essential steps in maintaining robust web application security. Remember, it's not a matter of if an attack will happen but when, so being prepared is key to safeguarding your web apps and user data.</p>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Are you new to <strong>Data Science?</strong> Do you want to build a career along the field of data? This article is certainly for you.  </p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VYW_TEwm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://uwo.ca/sci/datascience/img/Placeholders/Data%2520Science%2520Slide.jpg" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--VYW_TEwm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://uwo.ca/sci/datascience/img/Placeholders/Data%2520Science%2520Slide.jpg" alt="Data Science" width="800" height="250"></a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>" <strong>Data Science</strong> can be described as a field of study that involves manipulating and analyzing raw data or complex data sets using statistical computing methods and machine learning techniques to draw insights in order to make data-driven decisions."<br><br>
</p>
  
</blockquote>

<p>Data Science is one of the fast growing fields of the 21st Century. Data science has rapidly evolved in the recent era due to increased amounts of data in big companies and the corporate world which must be analyzed in order to provide data-driven business decisions.<br><br>
The field is immensely lucrative with a good pay even for the entry level personnel. Individuals who work in this field must be able to work with Big Data in order to provide solutions to the ever changing technology and the business sector.<br>
<br><br>
The increasing value for data scientists lies within the endless need of businesses to harness large amounts of data in order to come up with a viable present and future solutions. Therefore, data science provides the conduit between raw data and business insights. It allows for the manipulation of large raw meaningless data stored in databases to extract meaningful value.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Data science is therefore one of the key drivers of today's economies as most of the steps being taken by government's and organizations to combat modern problems rely on keen analysis of data. Data Science can therefore be used to predict the future occurrences and trends. </p>

<p>However, for one to really have a thriving career in this field, it must be instigated by passion for problem-solving rather than the money motive. One must be able to commit themselves into learning. There are numerous online courses, tutorials and YouTube videos where one can be able gain enough knowledge on data science.<br><br>
There are also various bootcamps where one can kickstart their their science career. For in instance, bootcamps organized by <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lux+academy">Lux_Academy</a></strong> would be a good starting point   </p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Data Science Essentialsüìö</strong>
</h2>

<p>Any beginner wishing to venture into the field of data science must first equip themselves with the elementary building concepts that are inexpendable as far as data is concerned.  </p>

<p>Data Science is an increasingly dynamic field, therefore ensuring a progressive learning approach for a beginner is highly recommended. Data Science is a multidisciplinary sector made up of a triplet domain:  </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Programming
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that these three domains are correlated and intertwined. Therefore understanding the three and having a concrete knowledge is very vital. <br>
<br></p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Mathematics</strong>
</h2>

<p>Mathematics in data science helps one to choose appropriate procedures and diagnose problems<br>
appropriately. It is one of the core building blocks of data science due to the fact that data comes in unusual formats. Some key components of maths one should pay close attention to include:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_probability.asp">Probability</a><br><br>
b) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_statistics.asp">Calculus</a><br><br>
c) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/ai/ai_algebra.asp">Linear Algebra</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>
  
  
  a) Probability
</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/probability">Probability</a></strong> is the likelihood of an occurrence of an event. Data science uses the various types of distributions such as <strong>normal distribution, Bernoulli distribution* and *uniform distribution</strong> to predict the likelihood of an occurrence.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  b) Calculus
</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1">Calculus</a></strong> in mathematics can be simply defined as the study of instantaneous or continuous the rate of change. <strong>Optimization</strong> and <strong>integration</strong> are important areas in Calculus that are very key in data science.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  c) Linear Algebra
</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</a></strong> is a mathematical field concerned with linear equations. <strong>Vectors</strong> represent data points while <strong>scalars</strong> represent numerical values in data science. However, there are a whole lot of Linear Algebra such as matrices, mappings and many more which are covered in Data Science.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Statistics</strong>
</h2>

<p>Statistical concepts such as hypothesis testing, p-values, mean and average are key to data science. <strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> helps one to describe the characteristics of a dataset, making it easier for one to understand and interpret data while <strong>inferential Statistics</strong> is used for making estimates about a population and hypothesis testing.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong>Programming</strong>
</h2>

<p>I would be obliged to say that programming is the most important cornerstone concept of data science.<br><br>
Whichever the programming language of choice, you must be able to have a solid knowledge of the language's variables, loops, functions and datatypes.<br><br>
The ability to work with databases relies on a strong background of programming. There has always been a debate about which language should one learn or which language should precede the other. Is it <strong>Python, R or SQL?</strong><br>
There are various languages to work with various types of datasets and databases but i will only outline the major languages that cut across the field. Different companies also prefer different languages which lays responsibility for one to be conversant with the key languages.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  - <a href="https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/">Python</a>
</h3>

<p>Python is essential in data science due to it's flexibility and the availability of its huge libraries which enables data scientists to easily work with data. Python's syntax is also easy to grasp. The key Python libraries for Data Science include <strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a></strong>. Python consists of many libraries in addition to the three.<br><br>
You should be able to understand basic python like its syntax and various data structures such as lists, tuples and lists.  </p>

<h2>
  
  
  <strong><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-programming-for-data-science/">R</a></strong>
</h2>

<p>R is an open-source language which provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data. R offers powerful data manipulation and transformation capabilities, allowing users to clean, reshape, and prepare data for analysis.<br><br>
The <strong>"dplyr" and "tidyr"</strong> packages, for example, are popular tools for data wrangling.  R provides a variety of machine learning libraries and packages e.g. <strong>caret, randomForest, xgboost</strong> that allow data scientists to build and evaluate predictive models.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">SQL</a>
</h3>

<p><strong>SQL</strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/#gsc.tab=0">Structured Query Language</a></strong> is a query language that is used for interacting with relational databases.<br><br>
You may be asking yourself now <strong>what is a database or what is to query?</strong><br>
A <strong>database</strong> is just a collection or related data which are organized in tables and columns. A phonebook for instance is a database because it has a collection of all your contacts which have similar characteristics like the phone number and a name, very simple.<br><br>
To <strong>query</strong> is to simply issue a request or a command to the database for a specific information. Therefore, <strong>SQL</strong> is used to interact with databases through a <strong><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/index.htm">Database Management System (RDMS)</a></strong><br><br>
The main purpose of a RDMS is to perform the <strong>CRUD</strong> operations <strong>(Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete)</strong> data on a database.<br>
<br></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Machine Learning
</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial">Machine learning</a></strong> is one of the fields of Artificial Intelligence which primarily involves development of models and algorithms that enable machines to learn, adapt and communicate with each other.<br><br>
In the field of data science, machine learning is a valuable tool that enables extraction of patterns and insights from datasets. There are various types of machine learning such as <strong>supervised, unsupervised and deep learning.</strong></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Data Visualization
</h3>

<p>After performing the various operations on data, effective visualization is essential in communicating the insights.  Various data visualization tools such as <strong><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tableau/index.htm">Tableau</a></strong> enable one to provide data visualizations that are easily understood by everyone.<br>
 One must also be able to present the insights in a fluent and appealing way to the respective audience. Therefore, data science does not entirely rely on the technical skills of working with data.<br><br>
Communication skills is key for a data scientist as insights must be relayed with utmost fluency.<br><br>
<br> <br>
Finally, it is very crucial for one to build up their <strong>portifolio</strong> while learning. One should commit themselves to building projects and writing articles about data science. These articles and projects go a long way on increasing your probability of securing a career in a data related field.<br><br>
<strong><a href="https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners">Github</a></strong> is a good starting point where you can create an account and include all your articles and projects in repositories. One can also use <strong><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a></strong> where you can interact with fellow data scientists and get access to large amounts of data sets.</p>
