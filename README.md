 #### - [Suspense your federated component with caution](https://dev.to/ibrahimshamma99/suspense-your-federated-component-with-caution-2gnc) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>When you see examples of federated components, you will mostly see it wrapped by <code>React.Suspense</code>, which basically returns a fallback component until your component is loaded, but suspense does not handle if your federated component throws an error or your micro-site is down, in that case you need to read <a href="https://dev.to/ibrahimshamma99/always-have-plan-b-when-your-federated-component-fails-35di">this article</a> where we explain to handle the situation when we unable to load the component.</p>

<p>When we want to <code>Suspense</code> our federated component we need to take care of the followings:</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Your Federated component may be slow to respond
</h2>

<p>You better have a spinner inside the fallback component for example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight tsx"><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span> <span class="na">fallback</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Spinner</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">FederatedComponent</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nc">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>but the above code can cause an obvious issue, I may have multiple federated component in one page, so: </p>

<h2>
  
  
  You may consider not showing multiple spinners in your page
</h2>

<p>In this case you need to do the following:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight tsx"><code><span class="c1">// DO NOT DO THIS</span>
<span class="p">&lt;&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span> <span class="na">fallback</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Spinner</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">FederatedComponent1</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nc">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span> <span class="na">fallback</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Spinner</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">FederatedComponent2</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nc">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/&gt;</span>


<span class="c1">// DO THIS</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span> <span class="na">fallback</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="si">{</span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Spinner</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">FederatedComponent1</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nc">FederatedComponent2</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;/&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nc">React</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Suspense</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Again checkout the federated wrapper shown in <a href="https://dev.to/ibrahimshamma99/always-have-plan-b-when-your-federated-component-fails-35di">this article</a>, to make sure if your federated sites are not showing for whatever reason, you load a local fallback component.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Since we are lazy loading components, these components should have nothing to do with SEO
</h2>

<p>The crawlers will not wait to scrape the site with the lazily loaded component, so you need your SEO content to be part of your <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fcp">FCP</a> </p>

<h3>
  
  
  Side Note: making the intellisense recognize your federated component
</h3>

<p>In the previous blogs we used the definition <code>react-app-env.d.ts</code> for declaring modules like:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight typescript"><code><span class="kr">declare</span> <span class="kr">module</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">app1/FederatedComponent1</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kr">declare</span> <span class="kr">module</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">app1/FederatedComponent2</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>We can do it in a better fashion where we leverage the types and all ts cool features by going into the <code>host</code> <code>tsconfig</code><br>
and in the <code>compilerOptions</code> we add in the following in the <code>paths</code> properity:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nl">"compilerOptions"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

        </span><span class="nl">"paths"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nl">"app1/*"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"path/to/app1/federated-components-dir/*"</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>or just add each federated component one by one:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight json"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="nl">"compilerOptions"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"paths"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
           </span><span class="nl">"app1/FederatedComponent1"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"path/to/app1/federated-component-1"</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w">
            </span><span class="nl">"app1/FederatedComponent2"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"path/to/app1/federated-component-2"</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">

</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

</div>



<p>in this way the <a href="https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server">ts server</a> can detect and parse the component from the microfronent, thanks to monorepos!</p>

 #### - [What is selenium? Why do we use selenium for automation?](https://dev.to/sadiquaakthar/what-is-selenium-why-do-we-use-selenium-for-automation-bi) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Selenium is mainly used to empower Automation in Web Testing and Beyond</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving technology of software development and quality assurance, automation has become an indispensable tool. Automation not only accelerates the testing process but also enhances its accuracy and repeatability. In this, Selenium emerges as a powerful and versatile open-source framework that has revolutionized web automation.</p>

<p>What is Selenium?</p>

<p>Selenium is a suite of tools and an open-source framework that provides a means to automate web browsers. It allows testers and developers to control and interact with web applications programmatically, replicating user interactions as if a human were operating the browser. Selenium consists of several components, each designed to cater to specific automation needs:</p>

<p><strong>Selenium WebDriver:</strong> It is the most crucial component of Selenium. WebDriver is a browser automation API that provides a mechanism for interacting with web elements, navigating between pages, and performing various actions on a web application. It can support multiple programming languages like Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and more, making it accessible to a broad range of developers.</p>

<p><strong>Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment):</strong> Selenium IDE is a browser extension that offers a record-and-playback functionality. It's an excellent entry point for beginners or non-technical users who want to create basic automation scripts without much coding. It is limited in terms of advanced capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Selenium Grid:</strong> Selenium Grid allows parallel execution of tests on multiple machines and browsers simultaneously. This is particularly valuable for testing compatibility and scaling test suites, reducing testing time, and improving efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Why Use Selenium for Automation?</strong></p>

<p>Selenium's popularity in the field of automation can be attributed to several reasons:</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> One of the most significant advantages of Selenium is its ability to automate across different web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. This ensures that web applications are thoroughly tested for compatibility and functionality on various browsers.</p>

<p><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Selenium is platform-independent, meaning it can be run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This flexibility makes it adaptable to diverse development and testing environments.</p>

<p><strong>Programming Language Support:</strong> Selenium supports multiple programming languages, providing the freedom to choose the language that best suits the automation team's expertise and project requirements. Whether it's Java, Python, C#, Ruby, or others.</p>

<p><strong>Extensibility:</strong> Selenium's flexibility extends to integration with various testing frameworks (e.g., TestNG, JUnit), build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), and Continuous Integration (CI) systems (e.g., Jenkins). This enables the creation of complex testing scenarios, facilitates easy reporting, and ensures that automated tests are seamlessly integrated into the development pipeline.</p>

<p><strong>Parallel Testing with Selenium Grid:</strong> Selenium Grid makes it possible to execute tests in parallel on multiple machines and browsers. This drastically reduces testing time, aids in faster issue identification, and contributes to a more efficient testing process.</p>

<p><strong>Active Community and Ecosystem:</strong> Selenium boasts a large and active user community. As an open-source project, it benefits from ongoing development, continuous support, and contributions from users around the world. This translates into an abundance of resources, libraries, and plugins to assist users in solving a wide array of automation challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Record and Playback with Selenium IDE:</strong> Selenium IDE, although less powerful than Selenium WebDriver, provides a user-friendly record-and-playback feature. This is particularly helpful for non-technical users or beginners who wish to create basic automation scripts without delving into programming intricacies.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Platform Mobile Testing:</strong> In addition to web automation, Selenium can be extended to test mobile applications using tools like Appium. This makes Selenium a versatile choice for both web and mobile automation, allowing organizations to streamline their testing efforts across different platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Robust and Reliable:</strong> Selenium is widely adopted by organizations of all sizes and industries. Its reliability and robustness have been tested extensively, making it a trusted choice for automation. Its robust architecture ensures that tests can be developed to withstand dynamic changes in web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Cost-Effective Solution:</strong> Selenium's open-source nature makes it a cost-effective choice. Organizations do not need to invest in expensive automation tools, as Selenium provides a comprehensive set of features for web automation at no cost.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Selenium has established itself as a cornerstone in the realm of web automation. Its ability to support multiple programming languages, browsers, and platforms, along with its flexibility, extensibility, and active community, makes it the go-to choice for organizations seeking to streamline their testing processes, enhance software quality, and optimize efficiency in a rapidly evolving digital world. Selenium empowers automation in web testing and beyond, contributing to the delivery of reliable and high-quality software.</p>

 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><em>"What? Did I read the title correct?"</em></p>

<p>Yes! Let's jump into an example right in the beginning, 'cause why not?</p>

<p>You'll be able to do this,</p>

<p><em>index.ts</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight typescript"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">add</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">./add.rs</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

</code></pre>

</div>



<p><em>add.rs</em><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight rust"><code><span class="nd">#[no_mangle]</span>
<span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">extern</span> <span class="s">"C"</span> <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">isize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">isize</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">isize</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>...and even more, like importing native C functions from libc in typescript. <a href="https://github.com/tr1ckydev/hyperimport/wiki/Importing-libc-in-typescript">Check out the guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>"Wait! What?? How is that even possible!?"</em></p>

<p>Long back, when I was working on the project <a href="https://github.com/tr1ckydev/webview-bun">webview-bun</a>, which essentially is an FFI wrapper of the webview library APIs for Bun. It randomly struck my mind, why can't I import the webview C source file directly into typescript, if through FFI API we can import functions from shared libraries which are essentially compiled from a source file like c, rust, zig, etc., how about I create a way to bridge importing functions in typescript with the source file and automate and the steps in between, in a way that it looks to the end user that they are directly importing from the source file while all the hard parts are managed automatically internally.</p>

<p>I wrote a simple function called calc in zig to add two numbers. In typescript, I wrote an import function that would take the path to that zig file, spawn a child process to invoke the zig compiler to compile that file into a shared library file then open that shared library using FFI API and return the symbols which essentially contains the calc function. So when I used the function to import the zig file, those internal steps happened behind the scenes and the calc function worked. Then when I changed the operation inside the zig function from addition to subtraction and executed the typescript file, those steps happened again essentially recompiling the file and the new output reflected the changes. This is how the typescript file looked.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight typescript"><code><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">calc</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$import</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">./calc.zig</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">calc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">));</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p><a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/E3MQDZl9qsVwgnKA7b/giphy.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/E3MQDZl9qsVwgnKA7b/giphy.gif" alt="" width="600" height="600"></a></p>

<p>It appeared as if it was black magic in that function, importing the function directly from Zig but under the hood, the file is compiled into a shared library and it is importing from the library and not the source file itself. But, the syntax looked super clean and easy to comprehend. I recorded my screen showing this experimental prototype and posted it on <a href="">Bun's discord</a> server.</p>

<p>Soon, Jarred came across the message and replied that I could make use of the buntime (we'll call runtime as buntime, 'cause why not) Plugin API and implement my logic as a plugin which would allow me to use ES6 imports instead of that weird looking import function.</p>

<p>Honestly, before this, I never actually used the Plugin API, so I started diving into it. With some fair complications and a few rewrites, I was finally able to port that logic over to use the Plugin API. Now I could easily import the zig file using ES6 import syntax. Even though Typescript was still shouting at me because it doesn't know what calc.zig is or what the calc function is, it still blew my mind away because it looked terrifying.<br>

<p>So, I decided to make it even more terrifying. I added types.</p>

<p>Using typescript's <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#wildcard-module-declarations">wildcard module declaration</a> feature, I created a types.d.ts where I declared that zig file path as a module, inside which I added type definitions for the calc function. Now typescript is happy and when I hovered over the calc function, the types are working great as expected. The whole combination looked perfect, but it was still a static prototype and not anything people would be able to use in their projects. I recorded my screen showcasing this scary syntax with black magic happening in the background and even showed when I changed the operation from addition to subtraction, the changes were still reflected. I recorded for both a Zig and a Rust file and posted them on the server again. Soon, Jarred reposted both of the videos on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1681608754067046400">here</a> showcasing the power of bun. Everyone in the comments of the tweet went crazy to see something like this even possible.<br>

<p>Primeagen commented, <em>"This is super cool. Do you have any articles or anything I can read on this?"</em>, so I decided to write this article for him :)</p>

<p>People kept blowing up my discord asking me when I'll release it. I apologize for making them wait but its now out, finally!</p>

<p>The most difficult part was to make things dynamic because, in that prototype, I had to manually declare the FFI symbol definitions like argument and return types for the calc function and also manually wrote the type definitions too. I wanted things to be automated as much as possible and the user to have full control of every aspect when they would use it in their project. I wanted flexibility which put me into thinking what's the best approach to making this prototype into a real thing people would use in their projects. I experimented with various approaches but all failed in some way which decreased my motivation to work further on this project. I abandoned it for a long time and I also had university stuff going on in between.</p>

<p>My goal was, that I wanted the users...</p>

<ul>
<li>...to add support for any other kind of other language which isn't available by default, easily.</li>
<li>...to be able to swap implementations with their custom logic.</li>
<li>...to import any other kind of plugin and not just be restricted to loading other language files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three months later, last week I started from scratch. It was my fourth or fifth attempt at rewriting from scratch. But every time, I started all over again I had experience of the old failed ideas. This final time, I decided to approach this by taking advantage of inheritance, basically classes. Where I split the whole logic into their functions allowing the user to extend and override them essentially swapping the implementations with their custom ones. Took me a week to get everything working as I wanted it to. My most important goals are achieved.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Loader class can be extended by the user and functions can be overridden with custom implementations to customize the behavior.</li>
<li>Any kind of plugin can be imported through hyperimport.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not to mention but, this idea was also featured on the official Bun 1.0 launch video. <a href="https://youtu.be/BsnCpESUEqM?t=221">Watch here</a>.</p>

<p><em>"Can I use it? Is it on github??"</em></p>

<p>Absolutely! Check out the <a href="https://github.com/tr1ckydev/hyperimport">Hyperimport repository</a> and browse the <a href="https://github.com/tr1ckydev/hyperimport/wiki">wiki</a> for a comprehensive documentation with guides.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/tr1ckydev/hyperimport/wiki/Importing-a-rust-file">Importing a rust file</a>, for a step by step guide on setting up a basic hyperimport project.</p>

<p>Feel free to join the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tfBA2z8mbq">discord server</a>, if you have any questions.</p>

<p>If you have come this far, thank you so much for reading the article. The story behind a crazy experimental idea turned into reality. I am really excited and will be looking forward to what mind blowing ideas people can make use of it and push it's limits.</p>
