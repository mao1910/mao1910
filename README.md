 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Understanding developer personas is essential for building exceptional software products. By identifying different types of developers and their unique characteristics, we can tailor our products to meet their specific needs and preferences. This includes understanding their technical background, preferred programming languages, work style, and the tools they commonly use. By gaining a deeper understanding of developer personas, we can improve the user experience, increase productivity, and ultimately create better software products.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>Developing personas for developers can be a valuable tool for comprehending the requirements and experiences of various types of developers. By familiarizing ourselves with their skills and emotions, we can create tools that are more user-friendly and help them operate more efficiently. <br>
This will ensure that everyone is working together to produce better technology for everyone. <br>
It's important to acknowledge the hard work done by developers, and by employing personas to gain insight into their viewpoints, we can guarantee that they feel appreciated and supported in their profession.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Why Developer Personas?
</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Technology is ever-changing and developers are the ones behind the wheel driving innovation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Developers are the masterminds that transform ideas into reality, creating software, applications, and platforms that revolutionize the way we do things and push our society forward. <br>
Despite their critical role, developers are often misunderstood, underappreciated or unappreciated. <br>
This lack of understanding has led to missed opportunities in the tech industry that could have a huge impact on our lives. </p>

<p><strong>But there is a solution: developer personas.</strong></p>

<p>This powerful tool can help bridge the gap between developers and the rest of the world, unlocking the full potential of innovation and empowering developers to do what they do best.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  What Are Developer Personas?
</h2>

<p>Developer personas are fictional representations of distinct segments within the developer community. <br>
These personas are built on extensive research, data analysis, and insights from actual developers. <br>
They encompass various aspects, such as technical expertise, coding preferences, motivations, and pain points. <br>
By creating a comprehensive and accurate representation of developers, businesses and development teams can gain deeper insights into the minds of coders, enabling more effective decision-making and collaboration.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  How to build Developer Personas
</h2>

<p>To develop effective developer personas, you need to conduct thorough research. <br>
Start by directly engaging with developers through interviews, surveys, and observations to understand their challenges, goals, and work preferences. <br>
Mix qualitative and quantitative data to create a comprehensive view of each persona.<br>
It's important to remember that developer personas should be diverse and flexible. <br>
The tech industry values diversity, and so should the personas. Each persona should represent a unique segment of the developer community, from junior developers to seasoned architects. Embracing diversity in personas creates an inclusive environment where all developers' needs are met and valued.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Empathy-centered design and the Developer Experience
</h3>

<p>Have you ever thought about how understanding the unique personas of developers can greatly impact their experience? <br>
You see, it's not just about the tools and platforms they use, it's about their overall satisfaction and productivity, also known as the developer experience (DX). <br>
By taking an empathetic approach and gaining insights into what developers really need, businesses can create better tools that align with their workflows, allowing them to focus on what they do best. <br>
Not only does this approach increase productivity and efficiency, but it also fosters a sense of appreciation and belonging within the organization. <br>
When developers feel valued and understood, it leads to higher job satisfaction, motivation, and even reduces turnover rates, creating a more stable and resilient workforce.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Fueling Innovation and Collaboration
</h3>

<p>Innovation thrives when diverse minds collaborate effectively. Developer personas act as a bridge that facilitates communication and collaboration between various stakeholders, such as developers, designers, product managers, and executives. <br>
By humanizing developers and understanding their unique viewpoints, businesses can establish a common ground for decision-making.</p>

<p>In practice, this translates into fewer misunderstandings and conflicts arising from differences in goals or priorities. A shared understanding of developer personas helps align business objectives with developers' aspirations, leading to more focused and successful product development.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  The Role of Developer Personas in Talent Acquisition
</h2>

<p>In the tech industry, finding and keeping the best talent is an ongoing challenge. <br>
However, developer personas can help simplify the process of talent acquisition. <br>
By creating job listings, recruiting efforts and onboarding experiences that are tailored to developers' specific needs and preferences, companies can attract candidates that are a perfect fit for their organizational culture and objectives.<br>
Moreover, understanding developer personas enables businesses to identify and cultivate potential talent within their existing teams. <br>
By recognizing the career goals of individual developers, companies can provide personalized training and mentorship opportunities, resulting in more proficient and well-rounded professionals.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Challenges and Pitfalls
</h2>

<p>In the world of software development, developer personas are considered to be a valuable tool. <br>
These personas are essentially fictional characters designed to represent different segments of developers. <br>
While the use of personas can be highly beneficial, it is important to be aware of the potential challenges and pitfalls that come along with them. <br>
One of the biggest risks is relying too heavily on generalizations and stereotypes when creating these personas. <br>
This can lead to misinterpretations and even alienation of certain developer segments. To avoid this, it is crucial to view personas as dynamic and continuously evolving representations that adapt to changing trends and individual growth. <br>
By doing so, developers can gain a more accurate understanding of their target audience and create products and services that better meet their needs.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>In summary, the power of developer personas lie in their ability to illuminate the path to innovation in the tech industry. <br>
By understanding developers on a deeper level, businesses can create more empathetic and inclusive environments, fuel collaboration, and attract top talent. <br>
Developer personas not only empower developers to do their best work but also pave the way for groundbreaking advancements that shape the digital world of tomorrow. <br>
Embracing this invaluable tool is not just a choice; it is imperative for those seeking to lead the charge in the age of technology.</p>

 #### - [Setup Vite+ ReactJs with Tailwind CSS](https://dev.to/arindam_1729/setup-vite-reactjs-with-tailwind-css-4dj2) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <h2>
  
  
  Introduction:
</h2>

<p>We, Developers, always try to Optimize things! That's where this Combo (Vite + React + Tailwind) is gaining popularity among developers due to its fast development experience and performance.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll learn how to set up a Vite + React project with Tailwind.</p>

<p>Excited! Right?</p>

<p>Me too!!!</p>

<p>So without delaying further, let's Start!!</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q2EQrtKt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://imgs.search.brave.com/0lLW3nlxu4PqM89xaAsBjbT15LhBeM-G2YMoB5-tClU/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS50ZW5vci5jb20v/aWo5VVdQQ1YtdVFB/QUFBai9sZXRzLWRv/LWl0LWJyYWQtbW9u/ZG8uZ2lm.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Q2EQrtKt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://imgs.search.brave.com/0lLW3nlxu4PqM89xaAsBjbT15LhBeM-G2YMoB5-tClU/rs:fit:860:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS50ZW5vci5jb20v/aWo5VVdQQ1YtdVFB/QUFBai9sZXRzLWRv/LWl0LWJyYWQtbW9u/ZG8uZ2lm.gif" alt="Lets Do It Brad Mondo Sticker - Lets Do It Brad Mondo Lets Do This Stickers" width="181" height="200"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Steps:
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-1:
</h3>

<p>First, open the Terminal and choose the directory where you want to create the project folder. In this case, We'll select the desktop directory.</p>

<p>For that run the <code>cd Desktop</code> in the Terminal.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oUha-6Fm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694620556588/d0d6c43e-7299-4d8f-a5d1-85ac645be621.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--oUha-6Fm--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694620556588/d0d6c43e-7299-4d8f-a5d1-85ac645be621.png" alt="" width="256" height="82"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-2:
</h3>

<p>Now, Create the Project folder on the Desktop by running the following command on the Terminal:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm create vite@latest project-name <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="nt">--template</span> react
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>💡<br>
Change <code>project-name</code> with your project name.</p>

<p>Here We'll take the project name as Demo project.</p>

<p>So our command will be:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm create vite@latest demo-project <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="nt">--template</span> react
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This command will create our Project folder.</p>

<p>💡<br>
Note: Here <code>--template react</code> specifies that we are creating a React App with Vite.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tAm5uVGv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691074357013/36feac6f-2fdb-4ab7-9a37-2b22d34cdd44.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--tAm5uVGv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691074357013/36feac6f-2fdb-4ab7-9a37-2b22d34cdd44.png" alt="" width="725" height="202"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-3:
</h3>

<p>After Creating our project folder, Let's navigate it.</p>

<p>For that run<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>demo-project
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>After running this command, you'll get this:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AYDtentb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691074621189/fe2ab3e1-5567-43cb-a48e-cfee0f523090.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AYDtentb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691074621189/fe2ab3e1-5567-43cb-a48e-cfee0f523090.png" alt="" width="379" height="108"></a></p>

<p>💡<br>
Note: Change the <code>demo-project</code> to the name of your project.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-4:
</h3>

<p>Now, We'll download TailwindCss and other required dependencies.</p>

<p>Run the following command:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-D</span> tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This command installs Tailwind CSS framework, post-Css, and a post-Css framework autoprefixer.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EX9em2ZN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076580948/e7fbdcaf-bf1e-482d-a175-e612939d53e7.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--EX9em2ZN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076580948/e7fbdcaf-bf1e-482d-a175-e612939d53e7.png" alt="" width="757" height="187"></a></p>

<p>To confirm that these dependencies have successfully been installed in your project check <code>package.json</code> , It should look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ryF4JPIN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076428693/42cbe279-bdd3-42e3-ba45-d130633f8861.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--ryF4JPIN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076428693/42cbe279-bdd3-42e3-ba45-d130633f8861.png" alt="" width="800" height="644"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-5:
</h3>

<p>Now, We'll generate tailwind Configuration files.</p>

<p>Run the following command:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npx tailwindcss init <span class="nt">-p</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This command generates <code>tailwind.config.js</code> and<code>postcss.config.js</code> configuration files.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m60oZIfG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076599499/7d95c851-d4ea-44b8-a336-9cde111d0a08.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m60oZIfG--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691076599499/7d95c851-d4ea-44b8-a336-9cde111d0a08.png" alt="" width="574" height="100"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-6:
</h3>

<p>Next, We'll add the paths to all of your template files in your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file. Template files include HTML templates, JavaScript components, and other source files that contain Tailwind class names.</p>

<p>With this, the Tailwind classes will be applied throughout the project.</p>

<p>To do that, we'll add the following code to the content section of <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file.<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code><span class="s2">"./index.html"</span>,
<span class="s2">"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"</span>,
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Now the file will look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqTeqC8K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691077675568/0369d318-56f6-4a44-b947-c055afed8dbc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hqTeqC8K--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691077675568/0369d318-56f6-4a44-b947-c055afed8dbc.png" alt="" width="685" height="253"></a></p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-7:
</h3>

<p>Now that we have set up Tailwind in the project, We will add the Tailwind directive to our project.</p>

<p>To know more about Tailwind directives, check out <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives">This</a> .</p>

<p>We'll add the tailwind directives in <code>index.css</code><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight css"><code><span class="k">@tailwind</span> <span class="n">base</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@tailwind</span> <span class="n">components</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">@tailwind</span> <span class="n">utilities</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>💡<br>
There will be some default styles added to the folders. Do delete them and add your styles. Otherwise, I might create confusion.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Step-8:
</h3>

<p>We are Almost Done!!</p>

<p>Now We will start our Vite server by running the following code:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>npm run dev
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>It will open one link to Localhost.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GWqZ9-fQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691078339017/801f5873-be80-47a1-bf9c-77749d4f75af.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--GWqZ9-fQ--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691078339017/801f5873-be80-47a1-bf9c-77749d4f75af.png" alt="" width="568" height="244"></a></p>

<p>Now, After going to the link, you will find something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JPsRGiTu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691078454190/2b15afab-2f87-4d77-bb19-f3fe0fafc1ae.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--JPsRGiTu--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691078454190/2b15afab-2f87-4d77-bb19-f3fe0fafc1ae.png" alt="" width="800" height="442"></a></p>

<p>We got this because we haven't Deleted the default CSS styles yet.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  Final Step:
</h3>

<p>In this step, we will validate that Vite and Tailwind CSS work fine together. Let's Go to our <code>App.jsx</code> file and write this code:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight javascript"><code>
<span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">useState</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">App</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span> <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">App</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
            <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">h1</span> <span class="nx">className</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">text-3xl text-center font-bold underline</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
                <span class="nx">Hello</span> <span class="nx">world</span><span class="o">!</span>
            <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>        <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/div</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>        <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">App</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>And we got this output:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rX4gCnSa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691079276773/300d1765-55c3-46cd-ae46-1f0f538fe0fc.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rX4gCnSa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691079276773/300d1765-55c3-46cd-ae46-1f0f538fe0fc.png" alt="" width="800" height="347"></a></p>

 #### - [AWS Golden Jacket; Is it worth the race?](https://dev.to/aws-builders/aws-golden-jacket-is-it-worth-the-race-466a) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>So, I've just completed my AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification. This now brings my total active certifications to 12, the "full suite" of achievable certification. In doing so I'm now eligible for the elusive "golden jacket" awarded by AWS to holders of all certifications.</p>

<p>I've had a few people ask my about my certification journey and as often as the how did I do it, is they why did I do it.</p>

<p>This post will not look at how, but address they why, and is it worth it. It is subjective to me as a person, my current role, and my current employer. As such some of the justification might not match you or your situation. I acknowledge that and hopefully you will see why it was right for me at this point in time.</p>

<p>Please note that the order of reasons is not a ranking. It is just the reasons on my journey in the order that they became relevant for whether to go after more certifications.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 1
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  To help stand out in the talent market
</h3>

<p>Considering I have been working with AWS since about 2011 with significant hands on experience from about 2015 , my first certification was not achieved till 2018. Why did it take me 3-7 years? Well I didn't need it before then. I was in a large enterprise that recognized my skills and did not see value in a certification that expires. However, in 2018 I was looking for work and the certification was something that validated my skills.</p>

<p>So off I went and got the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate">Solution Architect Associate</a>, and started working towards my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional">Solution Architect Professional</a>. The idea being that along with saying I had done work on AWS and I could talk about AWS, I also had a certificate that said I met a certain level of knowledge.</p>

<p>It must have worked because it helped get me several interviews and my job at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/service-aws-cloud">Accenture</a>.</p>

<p>So, if you are looking to stand out and prove you can walk the talk, certifications can help. However, it is in combination with experience. It allowed me to pass a "skills required" list and get to an interview to demonstrate my skills.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 2
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  To help stand out in your company
</h3>

<p>So if you are in a job and not looking for a new job do certifications not matter?</p>

<p>Well, as with anything in technology, "<strong><em>It Depends</em></strong>".</p>

<p>At my first job using AWS it didn't matter. While they would send me on training for multiple technologies (CCSK, AWS, ServiceNow, etc.) the certifications, in their eyes, didn't add any additional value. As such they would not pay for them and I saw no benefit in paying for them myself when I saw myself being there for longer that the validity of the certification.</p>

<p>So, if your company doesn't see the value, by which I mean it wont improve your career opportunities, then it might not be worth your effort pursuing them. However, if they are not offering the upskilling and training I'd ask is it a good company to be with and maybe go back to why number 1 and get the cert to help you leave and go to somewhere that recognizes talent and development.</p>

<p>However, if you're in a company where certification help differentiate you, and/or they are willing to pay for them, then you might want to pursue them. For my team/role in Accenture, certifications are a differentiator and something that are discussed in performance reviews. Now, I'm lucky enough to have them provide vouchers, in addition to getting vouchers through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/">AWS Community Builders program</a>. So for me there is no financial burden, although there is a time commitment over and above my day job. However, I think you'd need to weigh up the cost vs benefit. If you can gain a certification that help you get promotion is it worth it? Well if the exam is Professional or Specialty at $300 and you get a pay rise of even $500 a year I would say that a 400% ROI is a great return.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 3:
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  To help your company stand out in the market
</h3>

<p>In a competitive market for companies, especially consulting/out-sourcing, certificates can help your organization stand out in the market.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/cloud/aws-business-group">Accenture AWS Business Group</a> prides itself on the breadth and depth of knowledge its team has. While this knowledge can be implied though case studies, thought leadership and references, a simple way to show it is by the number of certified individuals and the numbers of certifications held.</p>

<p>Similar to the partner accreditation the certified individuals can help customers decide who the right partner to engage with is. So while it might not improve your career outlook, similar to reason 2, if you company is willing to fund hte certifications why not go for it. After all they will do you no harm, and while not actively support career progression they will not count against it, especially if it is an external metric that is monitored.</p>

<p>This is also the reason that after completing the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate">Solution Architect Associate</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional">Solution Architect Professional </a>I went back and got the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner">Cloud Practitioner</a> certification. Not because I thought I needed it but it help with our total certification count.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 4:
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  I had the knowledge
</h3>

<p>For some of the certifications I already had the knowledge that put me in good stead for the exams. While AWS focused, both the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty">Advance Networking</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty">Security</a> exam outlines showed that good general knowledge in the areas was as importance on the AWS knowledge. My view having had experience in both security and networking was I knew the generic/industry why and how and some experience in implanting on AWS that it would be a relatively easy exam to pass. Again, with my employer paying for the exam, it was an relatively easy decision to make and I passed both with scores in the 800s.</p>

<p>This is also the reason I gained the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate/">Developer Associate</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/">SysOps Associate</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-devops-engineer-professional/">DevOps Professional</a> in quick succession. After a few years at Accenture and some projects with more hands on engineering, especially DevOps work, I thought I had the knowledge. I took a practice exam for the associate exams and got good scores so just went for it. After gaining scores in the 900s for both associate certifications it gave me the confidence that I knew what I was doing so went for the professional the following month.</p>

<p>When the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sap-on-aws-specialty">SAP on AWS</a> certification was announced in 2021 I thought it looked interesting. I had some experience in SAP and supported an SAP migration from on premise DB2 to a cloud x86 environment. After looking at the exam outline it seemed that it was mainly infrastructure focused. I thought with the overlap between the exam and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional">Solution Architect Professional</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty">Advance Networking</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty">Security</a> specialties, I would not need to learn too much. So after spending some time looking at the specifics of SAP on AWS such as overlay networks, SAP tooling etc., I took the beta exam, and after a long 4 month wait for the results, successfully passed.</p>

<p>So, if you feel you have the knowledge then go for it. This is especially true for the specialty exams where 50% is topic specific understanding and not AWS. If you think you have the right level of understanding and experience based on your career then just go for it. I know people who have converted from say Cisco certifications to AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty">Advance Networking</a> with easy because they know so much of the core networking components that they just need to learn how to do it on AWS.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 5:
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  As a method of learning
</h3>

<p>While certifications are not everything to everyone, I like the structured approach to learning. By having a goal and criteria to work against I can ensure my effort is spent on the right things. As I do more work as both an architect and engineer I realize there are new things I need to learn and have a deeper understanding of.</p>

<p>A big one for me was with database and the reason I went for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty/">Database</a> specialty. While designing solutions knowing the best database and best deployment method was something that cropped up more and more, especially with so many new options available from AWS.</p>

<p>So my goal was to go and learn about all the AWS database options, the features, and when and how each one should be used. While I did take a look at lots of different guides and documents I feel the structure of the domains help me focus my effort. For database the 5 domains are DB Design, Deployment/Migration, Management, Monitoring/Troubleshooting, and Security. Using this approach I worked through the different offerings and made sure I know enough in each of these areas.</p>

<p>As a result I ensured not only did I feel confident in gaining the certification but I felt confident in my knowledge and abilities when discussing databases. Again, through learning and certification I validated my knowledge and experience. I possess more than just the certification but the certification shows my minimum standard.</p>




<h2>
  
  
  Why number 6:
</h2>

<h3>
  
  
  "Gotta Catch 'Em All"
</h3>

<p>At some point you get to the "<em>the point of no return</em>". For me this was where the question changed from "<em>why would I get them all</em>" to "<em>why wouldn't I get them all</em>". I suffer a little from imposter syndrome and under-recognize my skills and expertise. While many people advocated on my behalf and extolled my skills and expertise it took me a long time to accept it. But when I got to 10 certificates its hard to deny I knew what I was talking about and could probably get them all.</p>

<p>So at that point I made the personal objective of achieving the final two certification within a year. During that year my 3 professional certifications would also needed renewing so just a little challenge.</p>

<p>Now, maybe because the order of certifications but the final two ended up being a little easier that I thought. Maybe some of this is also the fact that you learn lots of "generic" items across all the certifications that are applicable to all of them.</p>

<p>But when I looked at the overlap between <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty">Database</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty">Data Analytics</a> certification it is quite high in my opinion. So if you've got the knowledge on all the databases, how and when to use them etc. you probably have an easy step up to analytics because the difference is really, how to get data in, how to move it, and how to analyze and display it.</p>

<p>Similarly, in my view the overlap between <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty">Data Analytics</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty">Machine Learning</a> are quite high. A good third of the certification was around data management, manipulation, and topics that were also in the analytics exam. Another third was around standard AWS topics such as security, operations,  and DevOps. So again only a relatively small increment of knowledge to gain. And with a passing score of 720 in theory I could get half the algorithm and model wrong and pass.</p>

<p>So the why might be to get them all, but in response to the why wouldn't I, it became clear that it would be easier to get the 11th and 12th than it was say the 3rd and 4th. So why not do it.</p>




<h3>
  
  
  So, will I continue to maintain my certification level?
</h3>

<p>This is something I am considering and will depend on the certification and my situation when it comes up for renewal.</p>

<p>At present my plan is to let at least the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sap-on-aws-specialty">SAP on AWS</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-specialty">Machine Learning</a> certification expire and possibly the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-database-specialty">Database</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty">Data Analytics</a> certifications. The reason is due to the direction I am going. My role as a Technical Architect needs to understand these areas but they are not core to my role. Having completed them has given me the knowledge I need and I can demonstrate it by saying I achieved the certification.</p>

<p>For me the two professional certifications are critical so I will ensure these don't lapse. They will also renew the practitioner and associate certifications so that will help keep my numbers up. I will then ensure I maintain the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-advanced-networking-specialty">Advance Networking</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-security-specialty">Security</a> specialties. I see these two areas as fundamental to the cloud. Security I think is the specialty everyone should get as it is critical to success in the cloud. For networking, the type of clients I work with are typically large scale organization and as such networking, especially complex and on-premise networking is a key area.</p>

<p>And don't forget, I don't just have certifications. I keep my knowledge up to date, and gain a few badges, with lots of other training offerings. If you take a look at my <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/robin-w-ford/badges">credly page</a> you will see as well as certifications I have partner and technology badges. For me the biggest value is in the journey and knowledge I've gained along the way. The certification and badges are just a by product of that.</p>




<p>I hope this blog has been useful for explaining my journey and why you might want to go after all, or any, AWS Certification. If you decide you want to go for them good luck and I look forward to seeing your journey on becoming a golden jacket holder.</p>
