 #### - [Introducing Spaces: Build collaborative environments in a few lines of code](https://dev.to/ably/introducing-spaces-build-collaborative-environments-in-a-few-lines-of-code-3n01) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>Spaces comes with a purpose-built SDK to enable developers to add a collaborative environment around existing applications.</strong></p>

<p>We are very excited to announce a new product ‚Äî Spaces! </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ably.com/spaces">Spaces SDK</a> comes with an intuitive set of APIs that allow you to build realtime collaboration features such as avatar stacks, live cursors, member location and component locking, in days. Each API is optimized for their specific use-case, reducing integration effort.</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NiFIe1aW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aidlg30sqzw8gtpnf365.gif" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--NiFIe1aW--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/aidlg30sqzw8gtpnf365.gif" alt="Image description" width="800" height="449"></a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Spaces at a glance
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Feature specific APIs:</strong> The only product that comes with purpose-built, realtime collaboration APIs for adding avatar stacks, member location, live cursors, and component locking. All APIs are optimized for top performance. For example, the live cursors API automatically batches pointer position events to avoid unnecessary streaming of messages whilst ensuring negligible latency.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy to use:</strong> Spaces is a simple and intuitive SDK that can be used with any web application.</li>
<li>
<strong>High performing:</strong> Powered by our market-proven, realtime infrastructure that‚Äôs built for reliability at scale, backed by five nines SLAs and messaging guarantees.</li>
<li>
<strong>Realtime experiences unlocked:</strong> Spaces is built to work with Ably‚Äôs other complementary products like Pub/Sub Channels to unlock end-to-end realtime messaging throughout your app. While Spaces powers the features you need to enable synchronous collaboration for teams and manage their participant state, Pub/Sub channels allows you to flexibly broadcast and sync app state changes between members, your backend and any other pieces in your system design.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  Enhancing your product with in-app collaboration &amp; Spaces
</h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.ably.com/spaces">Spaces SDK</a> you can set up a collaborative environment on any part of your application (or your entire application) so that collaborators have contextual awareness of what everyone is up to. Members of a space can see which other members are online, what they are looking at, their location within the app (this could be a cell, a page, a slide or a folder) and any specific component they‚Äôve locked for editing. All of this and more in just a few lines of code.  No need to change your existing system design or app architecture. No realtime infrastructure to build and maintain to scale the collaboration to millions of virtual spaces and users.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  SDK feature highlights
</h2>

<p>Here‚Äôs the full set of APIs available in the beta release with many more planned:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Space:</strong> A virtual collaborative space set up on your application where members can collaborate with each other in realtime.</li>
<li>
<strong>Members:</strong> Online users connected to the virtual collaborative space. This powers an <a href="https://ably.com/examples/avatar-stack">avatar stack</a> for end users which is a visual representation of a member‚Äôs presence - showing them as online and connected.</li>
<li>
<strong>Member location:</strong> The <a href="https://examples.ably.dev/member-location">live location</a> of a user within the app - page, cell, slide, block or anything else that makes sense for your application.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live cursor:</strong> The pointer location of members in a virtual space showing what they are looking at. The <a href="https://ably.com/examples/live-cursors">live cursor API</a> automatically batches messages and provides the message rate required for smooth performance of 100s of simultaneous cursors (though we don‚Äôt recommend going beyond 15 for a good user experience).</li>
<li>
<strong>Component locking:</strong> Enables end-users to <a href="https://examples.ably.dev/component-locking">lock specific UI</a> components while making their edits, so there‚Äôs no confusion with other collaborators or disruption to overall collaboration in the space.</li>
</ul>

 #### - [Updating Docker Apps automagically with Watchtower‚ú®üê≥](https://dev.to/sliplane/updating-docker-apps-automagically-with-watchtower-1a61) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Have you ever deployed a Docker app on a server, but everytime you push a new version of your image to a Docker registry you need to manually restart your app? If you want to automate this restarting, this blog post is for you! I am now going to show you how you can do this with literally <strong>1 simple command</strong> using <a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower">Watchtower!</a></p>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you already have a flow to automatically build and push your containers to a registry. If you do not have that, I suggest you to read and follow <a href="https://josephrodriguezg.medium.com/build-and-publish-docker-images-with-github-actions-78be3b3fbb9b">this tutorial</a> or simply use a ready-to-go solution such as <a href="https://sliplane.io?utm_source=watchtower">Sliplane</a></p>

<p>Let's get started! üöÄ</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Setup
</h2>

<p>First, run your container that you want to automatically update. Then, run the following command after replacing <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, and <code>container_to_watch</code><br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>docker run <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">--name</span> watchtower <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">REPO_USER</span><span class="o">=</span>username <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">REPO_PASS</span><span class="o">=</span>password <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-v</span> /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock <span class="se">\</span>
  containrrr/watchtower container_to_watch <span class="nt">--debug</span> <span class="nt">--interval</span> 300
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>This will run the watchtower container (<code>containerrr/watchtower</code>) in the background (<code>-d</code>), name it watchtower, and pass in the username and password for your Docker container registry (<code>-e REPO_USER=username -e REPO_PASS=password</code>)</p>

<p>Watchtower will now periodically check if your Docker image has changed (in your remote repository!) and pull a new version once it has changed. It will then gracefully shut down your old container and restart it with the same configuration but with a new image. The default <a href="https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/arguments/#poll_interval">polling interval</a> is 24 hours, which is quite conservative if you ask me. You can change the polling interval with <code>--interval x</code> where x is the number of seconds to wait. If you want to check for updates every 5 minutes you would add <code>--interval 300</code></p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>That's it! Now your cool dockerized app should update everytime you push a new image to your Docker repository. If you want to deploy a Docker app without all of the devops pain and without any Docker repositories, check out <a href="https://sliplane.io?utm_source=watchtower">Sliplane</a></p>

 #### - [how much % you have used out of your life???](https://dev.to/rodonguyen/how-much-you-have-used-out-of-your-life-3nnb) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Hello fellow inventors!</p>

<p>So I developed a fun and simple app that tells you how many percentages of your life you've used. It's called "Time I Have Left" :)</p>

<p>The link to this app can be found at the bottom or the comment section. <strong>Like</strong> or <strong>Comment</strong> to let me know if you want to read more about the project or my tips on programming in general!</p>

<p>In this project, I decided to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript to learn more about its type-checking feature as well as integrating TS in a pre-built JS application.</p>

<p>The result? I feel safer with TS and the code becomes more readable with the Type and Interface declaration üòå</p>

<p>Also, do visit <a href="https://amazing.rodonguyen.dev/timeihaveleft">the app</a> too. Hope it provides you with a different len of looking at life! This can be a reminder of how short life is, a message to stop your procrastination or it may just tell you that you're old üòÇ</p>

<p>Again... please feel free to <strong>Like</strong> or <strong>Comment</strong> to let me know if you want to read more about the project or my tips on programming in general! </p>

<p>I'm also just learning to program, just like you :&gt;</p>
