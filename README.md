 #### - [Looking inside GPT-Synthesizer and the idea of LLM-based code generation](https://dev.to/robocoach/looking-inside-gpt-synthesizer-and-the-idea-of-llm-based-code-generation-41d9) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p><strong>GPT-Synthesizer</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer">GPT-Synthesizer</a> is an open source tool that uses GPT for software generation. In this post, instead of talking about releases and features, I want to dive deep into how GPT-synthesizer works under the hood and explain some high level ideas behind this project. Further, I want to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based code generation tools, and speculate on how they will evolve in future. </p>

<p><strong>Are LLMs good for code generation?</strong></p>

<p>Nowadays everybody is using LLMs (Large Language Models) for everything and that‚Äôs for a good reason; they are the shiny new technology and they are extremely powerful tools. We are all excited to explore where and how we can use them, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they are the best tools to get the job done in each and every case. LLMs are made for interaction through human language, and that‚Äôs where they really shine. Take chat-gpt as an example, where both the inputs and outputs are in human language. In code generation, on the other hand, the generated code isn‚Äôt in natural language. It‚Äôs in Python, C, or programming languages, with well-defined syntax and rigid semantics. All programming languages were made for the human programmers to describe their intent to the machine in a clear and deterministically-interpretable format. </p>

<p>Since software isn‚Äôt written in human language, why should we use LLMs for software generation? To answer this, we should recognize that there are two sides to software generation: (1) the input: capturing the spec, (2) the output: generating the code.</p>

<p>The generated code isn‚Äôt in human language, but the input spec is. LLMs aren‚Äôt the best tools for code generation, but they are amazing at understanding the intent. That‚Äôs where they shine, and that‚Äôs where the focus of their application should be. In GPT-synthesizer the main focus is on understanding what exactly the user wants to do. The code generation itself is the smaller piece of the puzzle, and isn‚Äôt the main focus. <br>
This doesn‚Äôt mean that LLMs are necessarily bad at code generation. LLMs such at GPT4 are so powerful that they can do a decent job of it. With throwing so much raw power at it, LLMs can basically solve the problem by brute force. However, the code generation is not the strength of the LLMs or LLM-based software generation tools. The strength comes in communicating through the medium of natural language to capture the spec. This is where the focus of any LLM-based software generator should be, and this is where we put our thoughts and efforts when we made GPT-synthesizer. So let‚Äôs take a deeper look into how GPT-Synthesizer actually works.</p>

<p><strong>How GPT-Synthesizer works</strong></p>

<p>The process of software generation in <a href="https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer">GPT-synthesizer</a> can be explained in three steps: </p>

<ol>
<li>Component synthesis</li>
<li>Component specification &amp; generation</li>
<li>Top-level generation</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Component synthesis:</strong> </p>

<p>First, GPT-synthesizer reads the given programming task provided by the user in the initial prompt, and breaks it into software components that need to be implemented. We call this step component synthesis. Then, GPT-Synthesizer shows the user the compiled list of components along with their descriptions, and asks the user to finalize the list by adding/removing any component to/from the list. The idea here is to keep the user in the driver‚Äôs seat by asking for his confirmation. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it is not the tool that invents the software; it is the user utilizing the tool who is in charge of the project. Figure 1 shows how GPT-synthesizer identifies a list of components in component synthesis. </p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Component synthesis</strong><br>
<a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pYreJy0y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eh7ko0h97wrwm1e5936h.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--pYreJy0y--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/eh7ko0h97wrwm1e5936h.png" alt="Figure 1. Component synthesis" width="800" height="360"></a></p>

<p><strong>Component specification &amp; generation:</strong> </p>

<p>For every component identified and finalized in the previous step, GPT-synthesizer captures the intent from the user; only when the intent is completely clear, it implements that component. The task of capturing the intent involves an elaborate process of prompt engineering that we call prompt synthesis. This is the heart of GPT-synthesizer where the LLM‚Äôs strong suit is used in processing conversations and generating questions all in natural language.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the process of prompt synthesis in which GPT-synthesizer uses a summary of the chat history plus the top-level information about the task, the output language, and the software component to generate a prompt that will be fed to the LLM to create a follow-up question. This process will continue in a loop until the spec is clear and the user has provided the necessary details about the design.</p>

<p>The idea here is not just to keep human in the loop, but to keep him in the driver‚Äôs seat. We want the user to make decisions on the details of the design. We made GPT-synthesizer as a programming assistant tool that can be used in the early stages of the software design to create a draft (a blueprint) of the software project. GPT-synthesizer explores the design space and identifies the unknowns; it holds the user‚Äôs hand as it walks though the design space, sheds light on the design unknowns, brings them to the user‚Äôs attention, provides suggestions on those details, and asks the user for clarification and confirmation on design details.</p>

<p>For a less-experienced user, who wants to write a software but doesn‚Äôt know where to start, or what goes into writing such software, GPT-synthesizer could be like a coach; someone that turns the unknown unknowns into known unknown. </p>

<p>Finally, when the component spec is clear, and all the design details are resolved, GPT-synthesizer generates the code for that component. Figure 3 illustrates the component generation step.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Component specification using prompt synthesis</strong><br>

Component specification" width="800" height="355"></a></p>

<p><strong>Figure 3. Component generation</strong><br>

Component generation" width="800" height="402"></a></p>

<p><strong>Top-level generation:</strong></p>

<p>At the end, GPT-synthesizer creates the top/main function which will act as the entry point for the software. As of now, this step is only supported for python.</p>

<p>By now, you can see that the heart of GPT-synthesizer is not the code generation, but rather the component synthesis and prompt synthesis; GPT-synthesizer‚Äôs strength is in capturing the specification through a conversation in natural language where the LLMs are at their best.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons we learned from GPT-synthesizer</strong></p>

<p>The following remarks summarize the lessons we learned from development of GPT-synthesizer:</p>

<ul>
<li>The strength of LLM-based software generation tools are in capturing the spec, and the spec cannot be captured efficiently in a single prompt. </li>
<li>Human should remain in the driver‚Äôs seat and control the design process. </li>
<li>A good prompt engineering is key to capture design details from user, and the LLM‚Äôs output is only as good as its prompts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I would like to step aside from GPT-synthesizer for a bit, and speculate on what I think is the future for programming languages in the presence of LLMs.</p>

<p><strong>The future of programming languages</strong></p>

<p>Programming languages are the relics of a past in which machines couldn‚Äôt understand the human language with its complex, irregular, and ambiguous structures. That has changed now. For the first time ever, in computer history, computers can understand us just the way we speak, and there is no need for us to speak to them in their language. </p>

<p>So what will happens to programming languages then? Are they gonna vanish completely? I believe it would takes years, maybe even decades, for programming languages to gradually phase out and be replaced by human language. It‚Äôs a matter of the quality of the generated code, the power efficiency of the LLM tools, and the legacy of existing softwares written in programing languages. Eventually these matters sort themselves out, and natural languages will become the only interface between humans and machines, and the programming languages will only remain as intermediate formats inside the tools.</p>

<p>When computers first came out, we had to talk to them in 0s and 1s which then was replaced by the assembly language. Later, we took one step farther from the machine language and described our intent in higher-level languages like C, Pascal, etc., and relied on compilers to translate our intent into the machine language.</p>

<p>For some time, if you wanted your software to run efficiently, you had to manually modify the compiler-generated assembly code, or to skip the compiler altogether and write your assembly manually. Overtime as compilers got better, smarter, and more optimized, the generated assembly got better and better. At the same time, with transistor scaling as well as innovations in computer architecture, the processors became more powerful; therefore the lack of efficiency of the auto-generated assembly became less of an issue. Meanwhile, the advancements in chip design and manufacturing technologies improved the capacity and speed of both on-chip and off-chip memories, allowing programmers to be more lenient with the size of the generate assembly. Eventually, the combination of these advancements shifted the balance from having the most optimized hand-written assembly code to saving development time and effort by trusting compilers.</p>

<p>With the success of the programming languages and compilers, we took more steps away from machine language, and used even higher-abstraction-level languages like Python or Matlab to communicate to machines. Now, with the invention of LLMs, we are taking one last step and completely switch to our own language to interface with the machines.</p>

<p>I expect the same scenario to play out regarding trusting LLMs with our code generation. Overtime, LLMs will become more powerful, more efficient, and better integrated with current ecosystems to generate better softwares. At the same time, the processing power as well as the data capacity of the cloud services will grow, and the communication speed will improve, driving down the cost per unit, allowing more forgiveness on the efficiency of the LLM process and the quality of the generated code. It could take several years, but I believe we gradually take our hands off of the programming languages and trust language models to handle them. </p>

<p>I don‚Äôt expect programming languages to vanish completely. I think they will exist as an intermediate  format the same way that the assembly language exists today. I would also predict that there will be a lot of consolidations in that space and only few languages will survive this transition. The traditional compilers and many other legacy softwares can coexist behind the scene and work under LLMs command.</p>

<p>It is somewhat easier to think of LLMs not as AI programs, but rather as human experts who can understand our requirements in human language, and utilize other tools such as legacy softwares (e.g, compilers, synthesizers, convertors, traditional AI tools) to get the job done.</p>

<p>These are my opinions and speculations regarding the future of LLMs. I am curious to learn about your thoughts on this matter. Please feel free to comment on that.</p>

<p>The OR operator¬†<code>||</code> uses the right value if the left value is¬†<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy">falsy</a>. A falsey value is one of the following values: </p>

<ul>
<li>0, -0, 0n</li>
<li>false</li>
<li>"" (empty string)</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>undefined</li>
<li>NaN</li>
</ul>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at examples:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="c1">// when left is falsy, the right value is used</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span>  <span class="o">||</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1">// Output: "right value"</span>

<span class="c1">// but when the left value is truthy, the left value is used</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Output: 12</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<h2>
  
  
  Nullish coalescing
</h2>

<p>In contrast, the Nullish coalescing operator¬†<code>??</code> uses the right value if the left value is¬†<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Nullish">nullish</a> (ie, <code>null</code> or¬†<code>undefined</code>).</p>

<p>For example:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight js-code-highlight">
<pre class="highlight jsx"><code><span class="c1">// only when the left is undefined or null that the right value is used:</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">undefined</span> <span class="o">??</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Output: "right value"</span>

<span class="c1">// Output: "right value"</span>

<span class="c1">// when the left value is not nullish, then the left value is used </span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span>  <span class="o">??</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Output:  0</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">jane</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="o">??</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Output: "jane"</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">""</span>     <span class="o">??</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">right value</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> 
<span class="c1">// Output: ""</span>

<span class="c1">// Output:  false</span>
</code></pre>

</div>



<p>Most frequently, you only want the right value if the left value is <code>null</code>¬†or¬†<code>undefined</code>. That's what the nullish coalescing operator¬†<code>??</code>¬†is for. </p>

<p>Happy coding!<br>

 #### - [Building a DataGrid with the right tools](https://dev.to/radubrehar/building-a-datagrid-with-the-right-tools-dil) 
 <details><summary>Article</summary> <p>Building for the browser has historically been very tedious. In the old days you had to resort to all sorts of hacks for getting the right layout - anyone remembers conditional comments targeting IE6-9? üòÖ</p>

<p>Yeah, we don't miss those days either.</p>

<p>Things have evolved in the last few years, and the amount of goodies JS/CSS/HTML/layout goodies we now take for granted is staggering. New CSS features like flex/grid/custom properties really make a difference. Also browser performance has improved a LOT, and today we can do things in the browser that were unthinkable just a few years ago.</p>

<p>However, not everything is easier now than it was back in the browser-war days. Handling all kinds of devices, managing changing dependencies, configuring build tools, choosing the right styling approach, proper E2E testing, keeping a small bundle size, CI pipelines, etc. are all things that can (and will) go wrong if you don't have the right tools.</p>

<p>In this article, we're sharing the tools we used to build <a href="https://infinite-table.com">the InfiniteTable React DataGrid</a></p>

<h2>
  
  
  TypeScript
</h2>

<p>It's obvious today to just go with <code>TypeScript</code>, but a few years ago, it was not as obvious. We've been using TypeScript for quite a few years now, and we're very happy with it. We can never imagine going back to plain JS.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  React
</h2>

<p>Building on top of <code>React</code> has given us an amazing component model that's very composable and easy to reason about - and the ecosystem is huge.</p>

<p>Read about our journey in the <a href="https://infinite-table.com/blog/2022/11/08/why-another-datagrid">Why another DataGrid?</a> blog post. Back when React was launching, many of our team members were writing DataGrids - either in vanilla JS or using some libraries (<code>jQuery</code> anyone? - we don't miss browser incompatibilities).</p>

<h2>
  
  
  CSS Variables and Vanilla Extract
</h2>

<p>As a <code>DataGrid</code> Infinite Table is built on top of CSS variables - we're going all in with CSS variables. They have a few gotchas in very advanced cases, but all-in-all they're amazing - and especially for performance.</p>

<p>Infinite Table is not short of <a href="https://infinite-table.com/docs/learn/theming/css-variables">CSS variables it exposes - see the full list</a>.</p>

<p>Using CSS variables/custom properties has been pivotal not only to the ease of theming, but also to the performance of the DataGrid.<br>
Being able to change a CSS custom property on a single DOM element and then reuse it across many elements that are children of the first one is a huge performance win. Our DataGrid performance would not be the same without CSS variables.</p>

<h3>
  
  
  <a href="https://vanilla-extract.style/">Vanilla Extract</a>
</h3>

<p>The single tool that has made our life a lot easier working with CSS is <a href="https://vanilla-extract.style/">Vanilla Extract</a>. If you're developing a component library, you should definitely use it! Not so much for simple &amp; static apps - there are other styling solutions that are easier to use, like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">tailwindCSS</a>. But for component libraries, <strong>Vanilla Extract is amazing</strong>!</p>

<p>Did we mention it's amazing? üòÖ<br>
The fact that you can use TypeScript with it, can use "Find All References", see where everything is used is a huge win. You're not writing readonly CSS anymore - because that tends to be the case with most CSS. People are afraid to change it or remove old CSS code, just in case those rules are still being used or referenced somehow. This way, CSS only grows with time, and this is a code smell.</p>

<p>With Vanilla Extract, you get to forget about that. You know what's being used and what's not.</p>

<p>Also, hashing class names to avoid collisions is nice - and something now very common in the modern JS ecosystem. It all started with CSS modules, and now it's everywhere, Vanilla Extract included.</p>

<p>Other great features we use extensively are:</p>

<ul>
<li>public facing CSS variables - their names are stable</li>
<li>private CSS variables - their names are hashed</li>
<li>sharing CSS values with the TS codebase is a dream come true.</li>
<li>Vanilla Extract recipes - generating and applying CSS classes based on a combination of properties. It's enough that you have 2-3 properties, each with a few values, and managing their combinations can be a pain. Vanilla Extract recipes manage this in a very elegant way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  
  
  End-to-end testing with <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>
</h2>

<p>Remember the days of Selenium? All those flaky tests, the slow execution, the hard to debug issues? They're gone!</p>

<p><a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a> all the way! 300+ tests and going strong! Yes, you read that right! We have more than 300 tests making sure the all the DataGrid features are working as expected. Sorting, filtering, row grouping, column groups, pivoting, aggregations, lazy loading, live pagination, keyboard navigation, cell and row selection, theming - they're all tested! And we're not talking about unit tests, but end-to-end tests. We're testing the DataGrid in the browser, with real data just like real users would.</p>

<p>Playwright is an amazing tool, but we're not using it standalone. Paired with a <a href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a> app, with file-system based routing, we've created files/routes for each functionality. Each NextJS file in turn has a Playwright test file with the same name, but a different extension.</p>

<p>This has the benefit that it's always very obvious which test is running against which page. The test and the route always have the same file name, just the extension is different. The test source-code doesn't explicitly contain code that navigates to a specific page, all this is done under the hood, using this simple convention.</p>

<p>This way, we have a very clear separation of concerns, and it's very easy to add new tests. We just create a new file in the <code>pages</code> folder, and a new test file sibling to it. Another amazing benefit is that we can start the NextJS app and point our browser to whatever page we want to see or debug and it's there. We can very easily do the actions the test is doing and see if we get the expected results. This is a huge win for debugging.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  A tailored state management
</h2>

<p>We've built a very simple yet highly effective state management solution for our DataGrid. It's built to make updating the internal state of the DataGrid as easy as possible - we want a simple API, with clear actions. Our actions map almost 1-to-1 to the DataGrid properties, which makes it very obvious to know who changed what.</p>

<p>We can't overstate how important it is to have a clear data flow through the DataGrid. This is because the DataGrid is by far the most complex UI component you'll ever use (and we'll ever build). You can't possibly go beyond that - at least not in common business apps, where you have the normal UI controls you can expect, like inputs, buttons, dropdowns, etc. Just the ComboBox can come near the complexity of the DataGrid, but it's still far behind.</p>

<p>It's important to be able to tame all this complexity - otherwise it can slow down the development process and bring it to a halt, making it difficult to add new features or fix bugs. With our current model, even though the DataGrid grew in complexity and features, we never felt our velocity dropping! We enjoy that!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  No dependencies
</h2>

<p>We're very proud of the fact that we have no dependencies in our DataGrid. When you install our package, you only install our package - and nothing else. Nothing that can go wrong due to version conflicts, missing dependencies, npm issues (<a href="https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/">remember left-pad</a>?).</p>

<p>Yes, we still depend on packages in our dev process, but we're striving to keep that small as well. It's already complex enough to keep TS, React, NextJS, npm (with workspaces), aliases, esbuild, tsup, playwright all working together in harmony. But we've got through it, and we're very happy with the result. It was worth it!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Separating concerns
</h2>

<p>We've separated our DataGrid into 2 main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <code>&lt;DataSource /&gt;</code> component - handles data loading and processing</li>
<li>the <code>&lt;InfiniteTable /&gt;</code> component - handles the rendering</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a brilliant idea! It's new? No! It's not our invention, but we're happy we decided to apply it.</p>

<p>It adds a better separation between the two big parts of the DataGrid. This also helps tame some of the complexity, while adding clarity to the codebase. It's easier to reason about the code when you know that the <code>&lt;DataSource /&gt;</code> component is responsible for data loading and processing, while the <code>&lt;InfiniteTable /&gt;</code> component is ONLY responsible for rendering.</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Conclusion
</h2>

<p>We're not sorry for choosing any of the above tools or approaches when building the InfiniteTable DataGrid component.</p>

<p>Our developer velocity is high, and we're able to add new features and fix bugs at a fast pace. We're happy with the result and we're confident that we'll be able to keep this pace in the future.</p>

<p>The right tools get the right job done! They make a lot easier. Looking back, we only regret we didn't have those tools 5 years ago - but hey, things are moving in the right direction, and we're happy to be part of this journey.</p>

<p>What are your tools for developer productivity?</p>
